<h2 class="nobreak">ABOUT THIS BOOK</h2>
</div>


<p class="drop-cap">DEAR ANNIE AND KATIE,&mdash;When I was a little
boy I often wished that my soldiers would come to
life. I used to think how grand it would be if only I
could have a city of little people on the dining-room table.
Of course my dreams never came true, even though one
day I had a brilliant idea, and wrapped a whole regiment
of soldiers in flannel and put them in the oven, hoping
that in this way I should find them really alive next
morning!</p>

<p>But nowadays I have a wonderful city of tiny workers,
that can be put on a table. In it there are soldiers, food
gatherers, bread-makers, undertakers, and a host of others.
It is ruled over by a queen, and each day the gates of the
city are crowded with the workers, who pass in and out in
hundreds.</p>

<p>Have you guessed that my wonderful city is really a
bee-hive? Although I cannot command my little friends
to do this thing or that, to come here or go there, yet I
am quite content to leave them to their own ways, and
just to watch them in their daily life, and to study their
customs and laws.</p>

<p>In this little book I intend to tell you something about
my bees. I hope that you will be interested to read what<span class="pagenum" id="Page_x">[x]</span>
I have written, and then perhaps, later on, when you grow
up, you may keep bees, and you will be able to study their
wonderful ways for yourselves.</p>

<p>I am sure you will join me in giving our best thanks to
my friends who have so kindly helped me in the preparation
of some of the pictures: to Mr. W. Barker, Mr. D.
Ingham, Mr. H. Mackie, Mr. G. W. Stephenson; and to
Mr. J. Lambert for permission to use Plates Nos. XIV.,
XV., XXVII., XXIX. and XXX.</p>

<p>My thanks are due also to Mr. W. H. McCormick for
his kindness in reading over the proofs.</p>

ABOUT THE BEE</h2>
</div>

<p class="drop-cap">NO matter how small an insect may be, it is sure to
teach us something interesting if we study its habits,
and try to find out how the various parts of its body are
used. Perhaps of all the thousands of different insects
upon the earth, the most wonderful of all are Bees. When
we speak of bees we generally think of those which live in
the white hives we sometimes see in gardens; these are
the bees kept by a man to make honey for him. You will
perhaps be surprised, therefore, to learn that there are over
2000 different kinds of bees known at the present time,
and that over 200 of these species are found in Great
Britain. These include the different kinds of hive bees
and also the wild bees, for there are races of bees just as
there are races of mankind. In this little book I hope to
tell you about the hive bee, or, as it is called by its Latin
name, <i>Apis mellifica</i> (&#8220;the honey bee&#8221;). In the first few
chapters we shall learn something about the body of the
bee, and its different limbs and organs. Later on we shall
consider the construction of the hive, and the habits of the
bees which dwell therein.</p>

<p>The word insect comes from the Latin, and means
&#8220;divided into parts.&#8221; If you look at the body of a bee,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_2">[2]</span>
or of any other insect, you will find that it is divided into
three parts. These three divisions are respectively known
as the Head, the Thorax, and the Abdomen. The head
carries the <i>antenn&aelig;</i> or feelers, as they may be called; the
thorax, or chest, has the wings and legs joined to it; whilst
the abdomen, or hindermost part of the body, contains the
stomach and internal organs.</p>

<p>There are three kinds of bees in a hive&mdash;the Queen, the
Drone, and the Worker, and a picture of these is seen in
Plate I. Only one queen bee is found in each hive,
though there may be several hundred drones and perhaps
50,000 or 60,000 workers. The number of the workers
and drones varies according to the size of the hive and the
time of the year.</p>

<p>The races of bees are many, but the best known is the
British bee, sometimes called the Black Bee. Why it
should be called &#8220;black&#8221; no one seems to know, for, as a
matter of fact, it is of a beautiful rich brown colour. Then
there is the Ligurian bee, which is of a lighter shade, and
has three golden bands around its abdomen, by which
you will easily recognise it. The Carniolian bees are
natives of Carniolia in Austria, and they also have rings,
but of a lighter yellow colour, while the bee itself is not
such a dark brown as the Ligurian. Carniolian bees are
supposed to be very sweet-tempered, and are therefore
sometimes called &#8220;the lady&#8217;s bees.&#8221; Whether they really
are better-tempered than other races is a question, for the
temper of the little insects depends a great deal upon
circumstances. For instance, if spiders have been trying
to get into the hive, the bees are often very cross, and
it is dangerous to go anywhere near them. But should
there be no trouble of this kind to worry them, the hive
may be opened and the bees handled without fear.</p>

THE QUEEN BEE</h2>
</div>

<p class="drop-cap2">LET us now look at Plate II., where an illustration of a
queen bee is to be seen. It will be noticed that her
abdomen is much longer than that of the worker or of the
drone. Her head and thorax are about the same size as
those of the others, but her legs are slightly longer and
differently shaped.</p>

<p>This then is the queen of the hive, and she has, as we
have seen, many thousands of subjects. We might imagine
that, such being the case, she would lead a life of pleasure
and enjoyment; but this is not so. In fact she is wrongly
named the queen, for she does not rule over the other bees
in the way we are accustomed to think of a king or queen
doing. She would be better called the mother of the
hive, for she is the parent of all the other bees. She never
leaves the bee-city, except perhaps on one or two state
occasions, so that she spends the greater part of her life in
the darkness of the hive. She is waited upon and fed by
her royal attendants, who also clean her and guide her
over the combs. Perhaps, some time or other, if you have
the opportunity of doing so, you may see the queen of
some friend&#8217;s hive. You will see her on the comb, no
doubt, and you will notice a circle of six or more bees<span class="pagenum" id="Page_4">[4]</span>
around her. These are her attendants, who face her and
do not turn their backs to her if it can be avoided. In
Plate III. is shown the queen surrounded by her attendants.
They are within the circle which has been drawn on the
photograph, and the arrow points to the queen. Great
care is taken of the queen, for on her depends the future
of the race, and so she is closely guarded as well as being
tended and fed. Every one of the little workers would
willingly lay down her life for the sake of the queen, were
this necessary.</p>

THE DRONE</h2>
</div>

<p class="drop-cap">NOW a few words about the drone, or male bee, and a
picture of him is shown in Plate IV. He is not so
big as the queen, though he possesses a more burly appearance.
Unlike the queen or the worker bees, the drone has
no sting, and so you may let him crawl over your hand
without fear of being hurt, even though he should become
angry.</p>

<p>The life of the drone is a life of luxury and ease, for he
does not work in the hive, neither does he gather any
nectar or pollen. He is fed by the workers, and he also
takes good care to help himself from the storehouses,
whenever he thinks he would like a little more food. He
generally finds some snug corner in the hive, away from
the bustle of the city, and there sleeps till perhaps mid-day.
Then at this hour, after a good meal, he sallies forth,
pushes his way through the crowd of workers, and with a
loud, droning noise flies away to some far-off flower, perchance,
and there basks in the sun. Before the afternoon
wanes, he returns to the bee-city, has another meal, and
then sleeps until next day. A very lazy life is this, you
will say, and I agree with you. But this life, like all good
things, comes to an end, and little though the drones know<span class="pagenum" id="Page_6">[6]</span>
it, before the winter comes they will be killed by executioners
duly appointed by the other bees, and so their
life of luxury will be cut short.</p>

<p>In appearance the drones are very beautiful, and if we
watch the door of a hive, some summer day, we may see
them come out to take their daily outing. Their eyes are
like enormous black pearls on each side of their head,
while the silky antenn&aelig; look like beautiful plumes. Their
thoraxes are covered with many golden hairs, which make
them look as though they were clothed in the finest yellow
velvet.</p>

<p>As they leave the hive, they create quite a stir amongst
the other bees. They care not for the sentries, and rushing
out, overturn the foragers who are coming in from the
fields. No notice is taken of their rudeness, but the
workers go on with their various duties, no doubt thinking
that ere long the day of execution will come, and that then
they will be avenged.</p>

THE WORKER BEE</h2>
</div>

<p class="drop-cap">ON Plate V. is shown an illustration of the worker bee,
which is the smallest inhabitant of the hive, but,
nevertheless, does the greatest amount of work. We have
already seen that there are many thousands of workers in a
hive, and that each one has certain duties assigned to her.
All are busy, and they work as though the future of the
whole hive depended on their labours&mdash;as indeed it does.
Each worker seems to be trying to outdo the others, in the
endeavour to see how much work she can crowd into her
little life. Laziness is unknown, and should a bee become
so badly injured from any cause as not to be able to
work, she is put to death, for the government of the bee-city
has plenty of mouths to fill, without any useless ones.
To us this may seem cruel, but we must admit that it is
economical.</p>

<p>The duties of the workers are numerous. There are the
water carriers, to supply the hive with water; the nurse
bees, to look after the young ones; the foragers, who
gather nectar and pollen. Then there are the builders,
architects, undertakers, scavengers, chemists, and soldiers.
Lastly there are the house bees and the ventilating bees.</p>

<p>Each bee is allocated to one or another of these trades,
and each one seems to know exactly how to do the work,
and always seems to be doing it! There is no quarrelling
as to who shall gather pollen, or who shall guard the city,
for all is arranged by some mysterious law.</p>

THE MICROSCOPE</h2>
</div>

<p class="drop-cap">BY the aid of a wonderful instrument called the Microscope
we are able to learn a good deal about the
construction of the different parts of the bee&#8217;s body.</p>

<p>A microscope, as perhaps you already know, is a sort
of strong magnifying glass, being something like a telescope,
but on a smaller scale altogether. You may see an
illustration of a microscope in (<i>a</i>) Plate VI. The tube
of the microscope is generally about six or eight inches in
length, made of metal and holding two sets of lenses.
The one through which we look is at the top of the
tube, and is called the eyepiece. The lens at the bottom
is called the objective, for it is the lens that is nearest to
the object that is to be examined. If you have a microscope
of your own, or know any one who has one, you
will be able to see for yourselves many of the things
about which I am going to tell you. For the sake of
convenience the parts of insects to be examined in the
microscope are generally mounted on little slips of glass,
and if you place a dead bee on a piece of glass, you will
find that it is more easily handled in this manner. Some
of you, however, may not have this opportunity, and so I
have photographed several different parts of the bee, by
the aid of the microscope, so that you will be able to
understand what you will read about them.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_9">[9]</span>Just as the telescope has taught its users a great deal
about the stars, which otherwise could not have been
known, so too has the microscope shown us wonders
such as we never before thought existed.</p>

<p>Before we consider the habits of the bees, it will be well
for us to examine, and to understand, the various limbs
and parts of their bodies, in order that we may the more
easily trace out the manner in which the little workers
accomplish their tasks.</p>

THE HEAD</h2>
</div>

<p class="drop-cap">JUST as the head of an animal is the most important
part of its body, so too is it in the case of an insect.</p>

<p>A bee&#8217;s head, as seen with the aid of a microscope,
looks very peculiar, but nevertheless it is exceedingly interesting.
A photograph of it is shown (<i>b</i>) on Plate VI.
The head is something like a split pea in shape, with
the rounded part turned to the front; it is joined to the
thorax by a thin neck.</p>

<p>The bee has five eyes, two compound and three simple.
The compound eyes are placed one on each side of the
head, like the eyes of the house-fly, and the simple eyes
are to be found on the top of the head. In Plate VII.
the position of the eyes is shown, but only one of the
simple eyes is to be seen. In addition to the eyes, the
head carries the antenn&aelig;, which are two in number, and
the whole of the head is covered with a multitude of tiny
hairs of a light golden colour.</p>

<p>The bee has, of course, a brain in the proper sense of
the word; it is, however, very minute, though all the more
wonderful for being so. The nervous system consists of
a number of &#8220;nerve centres,&#8221; which are situated in the
body. The chief nerve centre, or <i>ganglion</i> as it is called,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_11">[11]</span>
is in the head, and from this point multitudes of nerves
run to all parts of the body. The word ganglion comes
from the Greek, and means a knot, and it is really a knot
of nerves. The nerves resemble underground telegraph
wires, which perhaps you have seen; and like them, they
run in bundles, which in turn are enclosed in a pipe or
sheath. Each telegraph wire sends a message to some
part of the country, and the nerves of the bee, in like
manner, transmit messages to different parts of its body.
Other ganglia are situated in the thorax and in the
abdomen, but the largest one is, as I have said, in the
head. You will easily understand from this, that the
ganglia are almost like little brains, distributed in the
body of the bee. Now here is a most remarkable fact,
but perfectly simple when you understand what I have
just told you. Sometimes a bee may have a fight with
another bee, and perhaps she will be unfortunate enough
to have her head cut off. You might imagine that this
would be at once fatal to the bee, but it is not so. She
is still able to walk about the hive in quite an important
fashion! Of course she cannot see, nor can she feel her
way about with her antenn&aelig;, and she is therefore of no
use. Soon she will die, but the fact remains that a bee
can live for a time even when its head is cut off. In the
same way, if a bee is feeding on honey and her abdomen
is cut off at the waist, she will still go on sucking up the
honey, in blissful ignorance of the fact that her body has
been cut in half! Then if the abdomen is picked up and
placed in the palm of the hand, it will probably start twisting
round, in the attempt to bury its sting in the flesh!</p>

THE WONDERFUL ANTENN&AElig;</h2>
</div>

<p class="drop-cap">WONDERFUL as all the parts of the bee are, there
are none so wonderful as the <i>antenn&aelig;</i>. This word
comes from the Latin, and means horns or feelers, and
the antenn&aelig; serve many purposes. In the hive, although
all is dark, the bees are able to find their way about by
means of them; they build the combs by their aid, and
with them they communicate one with another. The
antenn&aelig; are used, too, for the purpose of smelling, and
curious to relate, the ears of the bee are situated in them.
We generally expect to find the ears of living creatures in
their heads, but in the insect world ears are found in many
queer places. For instance, who would look for the ears
of the cricket in one of its legs? yet this is where they are
situated. This is not the only insect which has its ears in
its legs, for those of the grasshopper are found in a similar
position. Then there is a kind of shrimp, called the <i>Mysis</i>,
and this creature actually has its hearing apparatus in its
tail! And so, when we remember these peculiarities, the
fact that the bee&#8217;s ears are situated in its antenn&aelig; is not
so strange as it at first seemed. In (<i>b</i>) Plate VI. you will
see the position the antenn&aelig; occupy on the worker bee&#8217;s
head, whilst (<i>a</i>) Plate VII. will show you the feeler in detail.<span class="pagenum" id="Page_13">[13]</span>
The antenn&aelig; of the worker bee each consist of a single
long joint, and eleven small joints. The long joint is
called the &#8220;scape,&#8221; meaning a shaft or stem, whilst the
small ones are called the <i>flagellum</i>, a Latin word meaning
&#8220;a little whip.&#8221; In (<i>a</i>) Plate VII. they have been numbered
1 to 11, as you will see. The antenn&aelig; of the
drone, while resembling those of the worker, have one
more small joint in the flagellum, thus making the total
number twelve.</p>

<p class="caption">(<i>b</i>)<br />

<br />
Tongue of Bee</p>

<p>The construction and movements of the antenn&aelig;
closely resemble those of our own arms, the flagellum
corresponding to the forearm, whilst the scape is like
the upper part of the arm, between the elbow and the
shoulder. Further than this, the antenn&aelig; are fixed to
the head in much the same way as our arms are joined
to our shoulders. This joint is called a cup-and-ball
joint, and it enables the antenn&aelig; to be moved in practically
every direction. In addition, each of the eleven
joints of the flagellum is able to be moved separately;
so you will see that a bee can very easily and quickly
place its antenn&aelig; in almost any position.</p>

<p>On again looking at the plate, you will observe that
the scape is covered by numerous hairs, which are both
long and fine. The first three joints of the flagellum are
also covered with hairs, which, however, are not like those
of the scape, for they are much shorter and thicker.
They look more like bristles, and all point in a downward
direction. The remaining eight joints are covered with
multitudes of still smaller hairs, and these again differ
in their construction. To give you some idea of the
complicated nature of the antenn&aelig;, I may tell you that<span class="pagenum" id="Page_14">[14]</span>
the drone possesses over 2000 of these hairs on each
one, whilst the worker has about 14,000. Each hair is
connected with a nerve which is so delicate that the
faintest touch of anything would be easily felt. The
nerves are contained in the central part of the antenn&aelig;,
which is hollow, and from there they lead to the ganglia.
The bee can tell instantly the shape, height, and
nature of any object by simply passing the antenn&aelig;
over it. You know that if a person comes noiselessly
behind you, say whilst you are reading, and lightly
touches one of your hairs, you can feel the touch
instantly. That is because each hair, like those of the
bee, is connected with a nerve. You will easily understand,
however, that the hairs and nerves of the bee are
infinitely more sensitive than ours. It is necessary that
the tiny workers should be provided with some means
of doing things in the dark, for all the work of the hive
has to be done under these conditions. The antenn&aelig;
serve this purpose perfectly.</p>

<p>In a very powerful microscope it is found that the
places between the hairs, in most of the antenn&aelig; joints
at any rate, are covered with tiny oval-shaped holes and
depressions. The nature and use of these holes are
most difficult for us to understand, and it is not yet
properly known for what they are really intended. In
the first place, they are so very tiny that we can hardly
imagine their size. They measure only about <sup><small>1</small></sup>&frasl;<sub><small>10,000</small></sub>th
part of an inch across, and each is surrounded by a
minute ring of a bright orange colour. It is supposed,
and I think it is quite probable, that by the aid of
these holes the bee hears. There is not the slightest<span class="pagenum" id="Page_15">[15]</span>
doubt that bees can hear, though at one time people had
quite decided that they were perfectly deaf!</p>

<p>In addition to these little hearing holes, there are
others called the &#8220;smell hollows&#8221;; they too are exceedingly
numerous and minute. Each of the last eight
joints of the worker bee&#8217;s antenn&aelig; is stated to have
fifteen rows, and twenty smell hollows in each row! That
is to say, there are over 2400 in each antenna. The
queen has not quite so many, having, as a matter of fact,
about 1600 on each; but the drone is possessed of the
most of all, and his number reaches the astonishing
figure of 37,000 hollows on each antenna. Every one
of those hollows is a little nose, so that the bee&#8217;s power
of smell must be very keen. What with the different
kinds of hairs, so numerous and yet each with a separate
nerve, the hearing holes, and lastly the smell hollows, you
will, I feel sure, agree that the antenn&aelig; are most complicated,
and you will understand why I call this chapter
&#8220;The Wonderful Antenn&aelig;.&#8221;</p>

THE EYES</h2>
</div>

<p class="drop-cap">THE same tiny head, which carries the marvelous
antenn&aelig;, is provided with two large &#8220;compound&#8221;
eyes, as they are called. If you are able to examine these
eyes with a magnifying glass, you will at once see that they
are lovely objects. The eye itself is of a deep purplish-black
colour, and has an appearance which is rather
difficult to describe. It seems almost as though it is
covered with the finest satin, for it glistens in the sunlight.</p>

<p>The microscope shows that this appearance is due to
the eye being composed of multitudes of six-sided cells,
resembling, in fact, nothing so much as a piece of honeycomb.
These cells are called <i>facets</i>, which means &#8220;little
faces,&#8221; and each one measures about <sup>1</sup>&frasl;<sub>1000</sub>th part of an
inch in diameter. Over the surface of the eye are
distributed numerous long, straight hairs; the chief purpose
of these hairs is to protect the delicate facets, just
as the eyelashes of our own eyes protect them. Bees
have no eyelids, as we have, and so they have to rely upon
these hairs to protect their eyes from dust and other such
foreign bodies. The construction of the eye itself is
wonderful to a degree, but it is also very difficult to
understand, because it is so complicated and minute.</p>



<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_17">[17]</span>Each eye consists of a great number of facets, which are
really smaller eyes, and this is the reason the eye is called
compound. The eye of the worker contains over 6000 of
them, and each one points in a slightly different direction.
Large as this number may appear, it is less than half that
possessed by the drone, whose facets actually number
13,000 in each eye. As a matter of interest, I may tell
you that the queen bee has the least number of all,
having but 5000. Each facet acts as a tiny lens. A lens,
as you perhaps know, is something so shaped as to throw
an image of the object to which it is directed. A camera
has a lens of glass, and by the aid of this lens a picture can
be taken of any object to which the camera is pointed.
In that case the image of the object is thrown upon what
is called a photographic plate. Our own eyes act as
lenses, and throw an image of whatever we look at, not
upon a photographic plate, but upon a sensitive surface
called the <i>retina</i>. This word comes from the Latin, and
means a &#8220;small net,&#8221; and it is a very good name, for the
retina catches the picture from the pupil of the eye, and
passes it on to the brain.</p>

<p>Although we might imagine that these compound eyes
were sufficient for any purpose, yet we find that the bee
has three more eyes; these are called the &#8220;simple&#8221; eyes.
They are situated on the top of the head, and you may see
one of them in (<i>b</i>) Plate VI. The other two are over the top
of the head, for the three eyes are arranged in this manner
<span class="large"><b>&#8757;</b></span> so as to form a triangle. You will remember that the
drone is furnished with a far greater number of facets than
the worker. Consequently the compound eyes of the
drone are much larger, and they not only take up the<span class="pagenum" id="Page_18">[18]</span>
whole of the space at the sides of the head, but also extend
right over the top, covering the position occupied by the
simple eyes in the worker. Owing to this fact, the drone&#8217;s
simple eyes are placed lower down, on the front of his
head, their position corresponding pretty closely to the
place our own eyes occupy. The simple eyes are so
called because they do not seem to be nearly so complicated
in their construction as the compound eyes, but the
microscope shows that they also have an elaborate structure.
If we were to cut open the front of a bee&#8217;s head,
we should find that the simple eyes are set like this:&mdash;</p>

<div class="figcenter"><img src="images/i_018.jpg" alt="" /></div>

<p>You will notice that the two top ones (marked L. E. left
eye and R. E. right eye) point in an outward direction, and
it is by their aid that the bee can see sideways. The lower
eye (F. E. front eye) is directed forwards, and with it things
in front can be seen. The simple eyes are surrounded with
tufts of hair (marked e. b. eyebrows), which are so placed
that they do not interfere with the range of vision.</p>

<p>I must just tell you something of the uses of the five
eyes. At one time it was supposed that <i>each</i> facet of
the compound eyes made a separate image of the object
to which it was directed. But this is very improbable,
for what possible use could there be in the insect seeing,
instead of the one flower at which it was looking, several<span class="pagenum" id="Page_19">[19]</span>
thousands of flowers each exactly like the other? It is
much more likely that every facet forms a picture of only
that part of the object which is exactly in front of it,
all the pictures combining to form a single image. No
doubt the compound eyes are used for seeing things at
a distance, and the simple eyes for objects near at hand.</p>

<p>It has been proved that bees can distinguish between
colours, and even that they prefer certain colours to
others; one of their favourite colours is pale blue. An
experiment, which is both interesting and instructive,
has often been performed, and it shows us that not only
is the bee able to tell one colour from another, but also
that it possesses a memory. Pieces of blue, yellow, and
red paper are obtained, and upon each is placed a slip
of glass. A little honey is placed upon the slip of glass
which is over the blue paper, and all three are put near
a hive. A bee is caught and placed on the honey. After
sucking some of it she flies to the hive to store her treasure
and quickly returns for more. She is allowed to make
several journeys between the honey and the hive, so as
to impress upon her memory that the honey is to be
found on the blue paper. Then while she is away at
the hive, the slip of glass is placed upon the yellow paper.
She returns, as before, to the blue paper, and seems puzzled
at not finding the honey there, but after a careful search,
she discovers the honey on the yellow paper. The fact
that the bee came back to the blue paper proves that
she has a memory and that she is able to distinguish one
colour from another.</p>

THE TONGUE AND MOUTH<br />
PARTS</h2>
</div>

<p class="drop-cap">THE tongue of an insect is called the <i>proboscis</i>, a
Greek word meaning a front feeder, or trunk, and
indeed the bee&#8217;s tongue is not unlike the trunk of an
elephant. Let us glance at Plate VIII., where a picture of
the mouth parts of the bee is shown. The tongue itself
is in the centre, and it appears long and hairy, tapering
to a fine point. On each side of the tongue are the
<i>Labial palpi</i>, which are part of the case in which the
tongue is kept, when not in use. Beyond these are the
<i>Maxill&aelig;</i>, or inner jaws, which form the other part of
the case.</p>

<p>Each labial palpus consists of four joints, the upper
two (Nos. 1 and 2 on the picture) being much larger
and broader than the lower ones, which are quite tiny
in comparison. They have several hairs growing upon
them, and these hairs are used for feeling. The importance
of hairs to the bee is very great, and we find them
all over the body. They are of different shapes and
sizes, and we shall read more about them as we come
to consider each kind in turn. When the labial palpi are<span class="pagenum" id="Page_21">[21]</span>
closed, they protect the back part of the tongue, the
front part being protected by the maxill&aelig;. These four
parts, when closed, make a kind of tube, in which the
tongue rests. Although this protecting case cannot be
drawn up into the mouth, the bee is able to draw up the
tongue at will.</p>

<br />
Tongue and Mouth Parts of Bee</p>

<p>(<i>b</i>) Plate VII. shows a good view of the tongue itself, as
seen with a high magnifying power. It is composed of a
number of ring-like structures, and is covered with hairs
which are regularly placed and point in a downward direction.
The tongue of the worker bee, it is interesting to
note, is nearly twice as long as that of the queen or of the
drone. This is because neither of the latter gather nectar,
and so they do not need such long tongues as the worker.
Her tongue being longer, she is the more easily able to
reach the nectar, which, in some flowers, is only to be
found at the bottom of a long corolla. The tongue of
the worker has from 90 to 100 rows of hairs, but those of
the queen and the drone have only from 60 to 65 rows each.</p>

<p>The tongue is extremely elastic, and is capable of being
moved in any direction at will. Some of the hairs with
which the tongue is clothed are of use for feeling, but most
of them are for a different purpose altogether. When a
bee pushes her head into the corolla of a flower, her tongue
sweeps from side to side. If there is any nectar there, it
sticks to the hairs of the tongue in tiny droplets, and in
this way it is collected. Later on we shall find how it is
dealt with after it has been gathered.</p>

<p>On (<i>b</i>) Plate VII., at the very tip of the tongue, there is to
be seen a small object like a spoon. This is indeed its name,
and it is used for collecting the most minute quantities of<span class="pagenum" id="Page_22">[22]</span>
nectar. It is covered with a number of tiny hairs, some of
which are split into several branches.</p>

<p>From this description you will see that a bee&#8217;s tongue is
very fully equipped for gathering small, as well as large,
quantities of nectar. Even the tiniest drop is carefully
treasured, for the bees know that &#8220;every little helps.&#8221;</p>

THE JAWS</h2>
</div>

<p class="drop-cap">WE have seen that the bee possesses maxill&aelig;, or
inner jaws, and we are now to consider the outer
jaws. On (<i>a</i>) Plate IX. is a photograph showing these jaws,
which have been separated from the mouth in order to
show them better. They are very hard, and have extremely
sharp edges, like a joiner&#8217;s chisel. If you have ever
watched a caterpillar feeding, you will know that its jaws
work sideways. It places itself upon the edge of a leaf,
and moves its jaws from left to right, one on each side of
the leaf. This action therefore resembles the opening and
shutting of a pair of scissors, placed flat upon the table,
and the jaws of all insects work in a similar manner.</p>

<p>The jaws of the bee are very powerful, and this is necessary,
for it is by their aid that the wax, which forms the
comb, is cut up or thinned out. Sometimes the bee may
come to a flower which is too long for its tongue to reach
the bottom. It does not waste time trying, but simply
bites through the flower, inserts its tongue through the hole,
and in this way obtains the nectar.</p>

<p>A short time ago I imprisoned a wild bee in a cardboard
box. Soon afterwards I heard a great noise coming
from the inside of the box, and found that the little captive<span class="pagenum" id="Page_24">[24]</span>
was hard at work, endeavouring to bite a way through the
cardboard. The noise made by its tiny jaws, as it tore away
shred after shred of cardboard, was like a mouse gnawing
a plank. I fed the bee with honey, and the next day found
the floor of the box covered with pieces of cardboard,
whilst quite an appreciable amount had been bitten away.
In four days the bee had cut a way through the side,
making a hole large enough for herself to pass through.
Seeing that she had worked so hard, for the box was really
a very substantial one, I rewarded the little worker by setting
her free.</p>

THE THORAX</h2>
</div>

<p class="drop-cap">HAVING now fully considered the head of the bee,
we will turn our attention to the <i>thorax</i>; this name
comes from a Latin word meaning the chest. It is the
second, or middle division, of the bee&#8217;s body, and to it
the head is joined by a thin neck. The <i>thorax</i> is the
centre of movement, for it is to this part that the wing
and legs are joined. Accordingly we find that it contains
several large muscles, for the bee is a very powerful flier.</p>

<p>If we examine a bee we notice that the head seems
almost black, the abdomen smooth and shiny, and that
the thorax has a beautiful downy appearance. This is due
to its being thickly covered with fine hairs which, when
examined with the microscope, are seen to have many
tiny spikes branching from them which are used for collecting
the pollen grains. When a bee enters a flower the
hairs are sure to come into contact with the pollen, and
by means of the spikes the grains are entangled and held
secure. The hairs of the queen and the drone are not
so numerous as those of the worker, because these bees do
not gather pollen.</p>

<p>If we wish to see exactly the construction of the thorax
we shall have to remove these downy hairs, for they are<span class="pagenum" id="Page_26">[26]</span>
so thick that it is impossible to see beneath them. How
are we to remove them, without injuring the parts which
lie below? An ingenious way of doing this is to fasten a
piece of cotton around the body of the dead bee, and to
hang it downwards in the hive, between the combs. In
the course of a few days we shall find that every hair has
vanished and that the body is beautifully polished. This
has been done by the thousands of worker bees, walking
over the combs of the hive. They are so busy that they
have no time to stop and inquire how their sister died;
and so they brush past, intent only on the fulfilment of
some particular duty. In their haste they knock against
the body of the bee, which is buffeted this way and that,
as the busy streams of bees cross and recross the combs.
After a few days of this treatment all the hairs will have
been removed from it, and we shall then be able to see the
actual construction of the thorax, and also the manner in
which wings and legs are attached.</p>

<p>The thorax, we find, is divided into three distinct parts.
The division nearest the head is called the pro-thorax or
forward division; the second is the meso-thorax or middle
division; and the third the meta-thorax or after division.</p>

<h2 class="nobreak"><small>CHAPTER XII</small><br />


THE LEGS</h2>
</div>

<p class="drop-cap">THE legs of the bee are not only used for walking but
they have also to take the place of hands and arms.
They are divided into three pairs, one attached to each
division of the thorax. Each leg has nine joints, which
have separate names. The last joint, which is really the
foot, has two claws and a kind of soft pad. The claws, a
picture of which is shown in (<i>b</i>) Plate IX., are useful for
walking over rough surfaces, and also serve as little hooks.
When the bees are wax-making they hook their feet
together, just as we take hold of hands, and they are
thus able to hang in long festoons from the roof of the
hive.</p>

<p>The pad is called the &#8220;pulvillus,&#8221; and is close to the
claws. We all know how easily a fly can walk upside
down on the ceiling, or run up a window pane. It is able
to do this by means of pads which it also possesses.
These pads are covered with a kind of gummy liquid, and
by their aid a fly or a bee can walk up, or perhaps it
would be more correct to say stick to, a window pane or
other smooth surface. The fly, however, can beat the bee
when walking on such surfaces, because it has two pads on
each foot, whereas the bee has only one. On the other<span class="pagenum" id="Page_28">[28]</span>
hand, the claws of the fly have no hooks, therefore flies
cannot cling to each other as bees do.</p>

<p>It is very interesting to understand how the pads are
brought into use by the bee. You must remember that
they are placed just above the claw itself; when the bee is
walking over an uneven surface the claw catches on the
roughnesses, and then the pad remains in its ordinary
position. When the bee comes to a slippery surface, however,
the claw is not able to obtain a grip, and so it slips
down under the foot, its place being taken by the pad.
This presses against the smooth surface and adheres to it
by means of the sticky moisture with which it is covered.
Here is a sketch showing the pad just coming into action.</p>

<div class="figcenter"><img src="images/i_028.jpg" alt="" /></div>

<p>The pads hold very tightly on to a smooth surface when
they are pulled <i>downwards</i>, as it were, by the weight of
the bee. But they are very easily loosened if the sides are
lifted up, and in this manner they may be peeled off the
smooth surface, just as we take a stamp off a letter. So
beautiful is this arrangement, and so perfect in its action,
that it is stated a bee can put down and lift up each foot
at least 1200 times a minute!</p>

THE FIRST PAIR OF LEGS</h2>
</div>

<p class="drop-cap">THE first pair of legs, or those nearest the head, are the
shortest of all. The most interesting feature about
these legs is a little semi-circular notch, and I have made
this sketch of it.</p>

<div class="figcenter"><img src="images/i_029.jpg" alt="" /></div>



<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_30">[30]</span>Under the microscope we see that around the semi-circular
opening is a row of about eighty teeth. These are
not biting teeth, but are more like the teeth of a comb, and
indeed this notch is a comb which is used for cleaning
the antenn&aelig;. You may sometimes see a bee bring up its
front leg to its head, and then move the leg outwards.
By this movement the antenna is drawn into, and through
the comb, the teeth of which soon remove any dirt or
pollen which may be sticking to it. Just above the antenna
comb, there is a kind of little hinge or lid. This is called
the &#8220;velum,&#8221; and its name comes from a Latin word meaning
&#8220;to cover,&#8221; for the lid covers the antenna when it is
drawn into the comb, and holds it there whilst it is being
pulled through. When we know that each antenna is only
<sup><small>1</small></sup>&frasl;<sub><small>125</small></sub>th of an inch in diameter, we can understand what a
wonderful little tool the comb is.</p>

<p>When we mention a comb, we generally think of a brush
too, so it is interesting to find that the front leg of a bee
has two brushes, which are shown in the sketch. The first
of these is used for cleaning the comb after the antenna
has been passed through it. The other keeps the hairs of
the eye free from pollen.</p>

THE SECOND AND THIRD PAIR<br />
OF LEGS</h2>
</div>

<p class="drop-cap">THE second pair of legs is slightly longer than the
front ones. Each is furnished with a kind of stiff
spike with which the wings are cleaned.</p>

<p>The third pair of legs are perhaps the most interesting
of all. They are the longest, and the hairs for pollen
gathering are far more numerous upon them than on the
other legs. If we look at (<i>a</i>) Plate X. we see that there is
an opening in the leg around which is set a row of spikes.
This is shown more plainly in (<i>b</i>) Plate X. As the joints
work on a kind of hinge, these spikes act like pincers;
they are known as the wax-pincers and will be mentioned
later. Another interesting feature is the <i>corbicula</i>, or
pollen basket, which is the receptacle in which the pollen
is carried from the flowers to the hive. You will see from
the picture of the worker bee, in Plate V., that the large
joints of the hind legs are much broader than the others.
They are also hollowed out, and around each edge are
numbers of spike-like hairs, which curl inwards over the
hollow. These make a sort of basket, and I am sorry that
I am not able to show you a photograph of this interesting
feature, but it is a most difficult subject of which to obtain<span class="pagenum" id="Page_32">[32]</span>
a picture. However, I have made this little drawing, which
perhaps will help to give you some idea of its nature.</p>


<div class="figcenter"><img src="images/i_032.jpg" alt="" /></div>
<p class="caption">POLLEN<br />
BASKET</p>

<p>I should tell you that the pollen basket is situated on
the outside of the leg, that is, the side which is away from
the bee&#8217;s body. On the inside are several combs, which
are made up of rows of spike-like hairs. When the thorax
has become covered with pollen the bee uses these hairs
to comb it out; this it does by crossing its legs below the
body. It is interesting to notice that neither the queen
nor the drone has pollen baskets.</p>

THE WINGS</h2>
</div>

<p class="drop-cap">BEES belong to a class of insects known as <i>Hymenoptera</i>,
which means with membranous wings; the
wings of the bee are found to be composed of beautifully
fine membranes. They are four in number, and, like the
legs, are joined to the thorax. The front ones are called
the anterior wings, and the back ones, which you will
notice are smaller, are called the posterior wings, because
they are behind the others. The membranes are
strengthened by a kind of framework, just as a kite is
strengthened by a framework of light sticks. The ribs of
the framework are called &#8220;nervures,&#8221; and, as you will see
from (<i>a</i>) Plate XI., there are divisions of transparent membrane
in between; these are called cells. The nervures
are hollow, and like our veins, they contain blood.</p>

<p>We have seen that the bee possesses two pairs of wings,
and we may wonder why this should be so, when we know
that one large pair is much more powerful for flying purposes
than two small pairs. You have no doubt noticed
that when a bee is at rest on a flower the wings are neatly
folded over the back. Now if the bee had only one
pair of large wings it would not be able to fold them so
compactly&mdash;the wings would, in fact, stand out on each side<span class="pagenum" id="Page_34">[34]</span>
of the body. We shall presently see that the bees, in the
course of their duties, have to clean out the cells of the
comb, and in order that they may do this it is necessary for
them to be able to crawl right into the cell itself. The cells
in which the young worker bees are raised are only <sup><small>1</small></sup>&frasl;<sub><small>5</small></sub>th
inch in diameter, and if the wings projected when in the
folded position, the bee would not be able to enter the cell.
The wings therefore have been divided, so that when
folded they may lie one over the other on the bee&#8217;s back,
and we find that the wings, when folded, take up only <sup><small>1</small></sup>&frasl;<sub><small>6</small></sub>th
inch of room. This leaves just sufficient space for their
owner to enter a cell. You will notice that a blue-bottle
fly has only one pair of large wings, for it does not need
to fold them closely over its back, as it has no cells to
clean.</p>

<p>Remembering what I have told you about the greater
flying power of one pair of large wings, you might imagine
that the division into two pairs which we have seen to be
necessary would handicap the bee in flying. The difficulty
is overcome by a most ingenious device, by which the
bee, when flying, is able to fasten together the wings on
each side, so as to form one pair of broad wings.</p>

<p>Let us now turn to (<i>a</i>) Plate XII., which shows part of the
wings on one side of a bee&#8217;s body. Along the top edge
of the lower wing there is a row of tiny hooks, and the
lower edge of the upper wing is curled over, thus forming
a kind of ridge. When the bee takes to flight the front
wing is stretched out from over the back, and during this
action it passes over the upper surface of the back wing.
When the ridge reaches the hooks it catches upon them
and is held fast. In this manner the two wings are locked<span class="pagenum" id="Page_35">[35]</span>
together. (<i>b</i>) Plate XII. shows the wings hooked together
ready for flying. When the bee comes to rest she folds
her wings, and in doing this they are automatically
separated, for the ridge slips away from the hooks that
hold it.</p>

<br />
Wing hooked, as in Flying</p>

<p>The number of hooks varies, and there are sometimes
more on one side of the body than on the other. As a
general rule it is found that a worker bee has from eighteen
to twenty-three of them, the one shown in (<i>a</i>) Plate XII.
having nineteen, as you will be able to count. The queen
does very little flying, and so her wings are not large, in
proportion to her size. Therefore she has not usually so
many hooks, and sometimes they are found to number as
few as thirteen. The drone has large and powerful wings,
and his hooks vary between twenty-one and twenty-six in
number.</p>

<p>Bees are able to move their wings very quickly, and you
will agree with me in this when I tell you that it has been
shown that the vibrations number at least 190 per second!
The flight of the bee is greatly assisted by a number of
air-sacs called <i>trache&aelig;</i>, contained in the thorax. These
fill with air and make the body more buoyant, just as a lifeboat
is made more buoyant by its air-chambers. When a
bee has been at rest for a little time it cannot begin to
fly straight away, for the air-sacs are empty. It therefore
runs along the ground to get a start, as an aeroplane does,
and by vibrating its wings fills the trache&aelig;.</p>

THE ABDOMEN</h2>
</div>

<p class="drop-cap">THE hinder part of the bee&#8217;s body is called the
abdomen, and it is here that the stomach is situated.
The abdomen is larger than either the head or the thorax,
and is joined to this latter by a thin waist. Insects do not
possess skeletons, at least not internal skeletons of bones,
such as we have. Their skeletons are outside the body,
and take the form of a hard outer layer which protects the
soft inner organs. This layer, or outer skin, is made of
a horny substance, called <i>chitine</i> (pronounced &#8220;ki-tin&#8221;),
which comes from a Greek word meaning a tunic or outer
dress.</p>

<p>Chitine is indeed a wonderful substance, and is found in
all forms and shapes, having a variety of appearances. The
hard black bodies of beetles are composed of it, and,
wonderful to relate, of this substance the downy wings of
the butterfly are made. You will remember that in the
chapter on the eye of the bee we saw that the facets have
a beautiful appearance; they too are made of chitine, as
are the tendons, legs, hairs, membranes, and many other
parts of the body.</p>

<p>The abdomen of the queen and of the worker is divided
into six rings or belts, but the drone, having a somewhat<span class="pagenum" id="Page_37">[37]</span>
larger body, has seven. Each ring is divided again into
two parts which are known as the <i>scelerites</i>, which are
joined one to another by delicate membranes of very fine
skin. You may have noticed that the leg of a crab is
jointed, and that the hard outer case of shell gives place to
a fine, but tough membrane at the joints. By means of
this arrangement the crab can move its leg with ease.
The joints of the abdomen of the bee are arranged in
a similar manner, although in this case the membranes
are of course much finer and more delicate than those
of the crab.</p>

<p>The organs inside the outer case of chitine are of most
wonderful and delicate construction. You may be surprised
and interested to learn that a bee has two stomachs,
and these are perhaps the most important parts of the
abdomen. It is not because the bee is a greedy insect
that it is provided with two stomachs, but each serves a
separate and useful purpose. One is called the honey-sac,
and the other is the stomach proper. As a bee sips the
nectar from a flower, it is passed down a tube through the
thorax into the honey-sac, which acts as a kind of store-chamber.
Here it is kept until the bee flies back to the
hive, or until the little worker may need it for its own food.
Leading from the honey-sac to the stomach is a very fine
tube, and at the honey-sac end of it there is a kind of
stopper, called the &#8220;stomach mouth.&#8221; Just as we can open
or close our mouths at will, so can the bee open or close
the stomach mouth, and so either allow honey to flow into
its true stomach or keep it stored in the honey-sac. The
latter is very tiny, and when quite full contains little more
than a third of an ordinary drop of honey. The tube<span class="pagenum" id="Page_38">[38]</span>
which leads from the one to the other is lined with fine
hairs, all pointing in a downward direction, away from the
honey-sac. When the bee sips the nectar it often
happens that some of the pollen grains from the flower are
taken in also. Now the bee desires to gather only the
pure nectar, and so it passes the nectar from the honey-sac
to the stomach by means of the tube. It then makes
the honey return from the stomach to the honey-sac, but
this time the hairs in the tube act as a strainer, and prevent
the pollen grains from returning with the nectar. By this
clever little apparatus you will see that the bee is able to
strain the nectar when flying from one flower to another,
or when travelling back to the hive. Besides the two
stomachs, the abdomen contains certain glands to which we
shall refer when we come to speak of honey.</p>

THE BREATHING APPARATUS</h2>
</div>

<p class="drop-cap">INSECTS do not breathe by means of lungs as we do
but through tiny air-holes, called &#8220;spiracles.&#8221; This
name comes from the Latin <i>spiraculum</i>, meaning an air-hole,
which in turn is derived from <i>spirare</i>, to breathe.</p>

<p>Crawling insects do not need nearly so much air as
flying insects, and so their breathing apparatus is not so
large. In the bee the breathing tubes spread over almost
the whole body, two of the largest extending along each
side of the abdomen. The rings of the abdomen slightly
overlap one another, and if you watch a bee carefully you
will notice that they are constantly slipping in and out,
like the joints of a folding telescope which is being opened
and closed. This is really the action of breathing, and
the bee draws in and then drives out air. If you have
ever rescued a fly which has fallen into the milk, you
will remember that it at once commences to clean itself
vigorously with its legs. It does not do this to make
itself tidy, but to clean out the milk which clogs its air-tubes
and is thus choking it.</p>

<p>It is interesting to notice that the mouth of each air-tube
has a number of tiny hairs; these serve to keep out
dust, which would interfere with the breathing. The air-tubes<span class="pagenum" id="Page_40">[40]</span>
branch off one from another like the roots of a tree,
and in order to give you some idea of how very small they
are, I may tell you that it has been found that a bundle
of a quarter of a million of them would hardly be any
bigger than an ordinary human hair!</p>

THE STING</h2>
</div>

<p class="drop-cap">WE have now only the sting left to consider. I need
not tell you what it feels like to be stung, as no
doubt a good many of you have had that interesting
operation performed upon you by some bee or wasp which
you have annoyed!</p>

<p>How very frightened every one is of the sting of a bee,
and those people who have never been stung are perhaps
the most frightened of all. After all, the sting is not so
painful, and it is very interesting to watch the angry little
worker drive its sharp weapon into our hand; besides
which it is actually good for us to be stung, and the reason
of this I shall presently tell you. The sting is situated
at the very tip of the abdomen. It would take up too
much space to fully describe all the details of its construction,
and therefore I shall simply tell you about the
chief parts, and also how it works.</p>

<p>Let us look at the picture of a sting given on (<i>a</i>) Plate
XIII., where is seen a sharp-pointed object surrounded
by fleshy matter. This is the sting proper, and it is very
smooth and hard, as well as being finely pointed. In order
to give you some idea of this, I have mounted alongside
a sting, one of the finest needles obtainable for comparison,
and you will see the picture in (<i>b</i>) Plate XI. The<span class="pagenum" id="Page_42">[42]</span>
needle is at the top, and looks like a great crowbar compared
with the beautifully fine and tapering sting.</p>

<p>This sting is really a sheath, or kind of case, in which
are enclosed two needle-like darts. Its purpose is to protect
the darts and also to make the actual wound. Outside
the end of the sheath are two rows of three, or sometimes
more barbs, which point backwards. Many of you, no
doubt, have seen in our museums the spears and arrows
used by savages, which have ugly barbs at their points.
When the warrior runs the spear into an enemy, it does
not slip out as it would do were the shaft just a plain one.
The barbs on the outside of the sheath are used for this
purpose, that is, to prevent the sheath from slipping out of
the hole it has pierced, until the operation of stinging is
completed.</p>

<p>The darts enclosed in the sheath are capable of being
moved up and down in it, by a powerful and complicated
set of muscles. They act like drills, and when the sheath
has made the first hole and, as it were, opened the way for
them, the darts commence to travel up and down at a
great rate. Every time they come down they go further
into the flesh, and so make the hole deeper. They, too,
have barbs which are more pronounced than those on the
outside of the sheath, and so take a firmer hold on the
flesh. You will clearly see these barbs on one of the
darts in (<i>b</i>) Plate XIII.</p>

<p>The darts themselves are hollow, and near each barb
there is a tiny hole, which leads into the central hollow,
down which the poison is poured. The hole made by the
sharp little darts is not deep enough to cause the pain we
feel when stung; this is due to the poison which is sent<span class="pagenum" id="Page_43">[43]</span>
into the wound. This poison consists chiefly of formic
acid, and is stored in the poison-bag which is shown on (<i>a</i>)
Plate XIII. The poison is forced through the holes by two
little pumps situated at the base of the sheath, and which
are worked by the same muscles which move the darts.</p>

<p>You will see from this that stinging is quite an elaborate
process. First the sharp point of the sheath enters the
flesh and is held there by its barbs. Then the darts work
up and down, making the wound deeper and deeper, while
the tiny pumps are forcing in the poison. So quickly does
all this take place that the sheath is driven in up to the
hilt and the wound filled with poison, long before we have
time to knock the angry little insect away.</p>

<p>When a bee stings our arm or leg we naturally try to
brush or shake it off. We have seen that the sheath of
the sting has barbs, and when we shake our arm the sting
is so fast in the flesh that the jerk causes it to be pulled
out by the roots from the bee&#8217;s body. When this occurs it
generally happens that a large part of the bee&#8217;s bowel is
pulled out also, and this causes the death of the bee in an
hour or so. If we let the bee alone, however, we shall find
that after the darts have been driven in as far as ever they
will go, and after the full amount of poison has been
pumped in, she will commence to turn slowly round and
round, and in this manner will extract the sting, as a corkscrew
is taken out of a cork.</p>

<p>The sting of a worker is quite straight, but that of the
queen is curved like a scimitar. The workers sometimes
sting bees from other hives, but the queen will never sting
any bee but a rival queen. The sting of one bee is immediately
fatal to another.</p>

THE ANCIENTS AND BEES</h2>
</div>

<p class="drop-cap">BEFORE we go on to consider the habits of the bees, I
think you will be interested to hear something about
their early history, and how they used to be kept in bygone
ages. Thus we shall be able to trace the progress of bee-keeping
from its earliest sources to the present day, and to
realise the wonderful improvements of modern methods
upon those of the ancients.</p>

<p>It is not possible for us to tell with any certainty when
bee-keeping actually commenced, but it has a very ancient
origin. No doubt for ages past it has been the custom of
men to obtain honey from the store of wild bees. For instance,
we read in the Bible that John the Baptist lived for
some time in the wilderness on locusts and wild honey.
The earliest records in existence show us that the Egyptians
kept bees in some kind of hive, and that they carefully
studied their habits. If you visit the Egyptian rooms at
the British Museum, you may perhaps see the sarcophagus
which contains the mummified remains of a great king,
called Mykernos. This coffin dates back to 3633 years
<span class="allsmcap">B.C.</span>, and Mykernos was at that time the King of Lower
Egypt. On the outside of the coffin is a peculiar drawing,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_45">[45]</span>
or hieroglyphic as it is called. It is something like
this:&mdash;</p>

<div class="figcenter"><img src="images/i_045.jpg" alt="" /></div>

<p>This funny little figure represents a bee, for at that time
it was thought that the bees were ruled over by a king-bee,
which the Egyptians knew to be larger than all the others.
Because the bees always appeared to be so happy under
their king, the Egyptians thought it would be a good
symbol to place on the coffin of their ruler. This is the
very earliest known record relating to bees, but we know
now, of course, that the large bee, which seemed to the
Egyptians to rule the others, is not a king but a queen.</p>

<p>Those of you who learn Latin may some day have to
translate some books called the <i>Georgics</i>. They were
written by a clever man called Virgil, and although schoolboys
do not always like them, yet they are most interesting,
especially the Fourth Book, which tells us a great deal
about bees. Virgil lived in a town called Parthenope,
which we now know as Naples. He was a great bee-keeper,
and was never tired of watching his bees at their work, and
moreover he left very accurate accounts of his observations.
Hives in those days were dome-shaped, and made from
pieces of bark stitched together, or sometimes of osiers or
plaited willows. We can imagine the learned Virgil walking
in his garden, surrounded by sweet-smelling flowers and
herbs, and by his quaint bee-hives. Below, down the
mountain side, lay &#8220;sweet Parthenope,&#8221; as he called it,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_46">[46]</span>
with its orange and lemon groves. Beyond the town lay
the most beautiful bay in the world, the Bay of Naples,
whose water, as blue as turquoise, shimmered in the
summer sun. Over all stood the crater of mighty Vesuvius,
from the cone of which a thin wisp of smoke hung lazily in
the atmosphere. In this way Virgil spent many happy
days, and in the book I have mentioned we may read of
his doings, and of his bees. Most of his ideas about bees
were false, but some of the rules which he laid down for
bee-keeping hold good even at the present time.</p>

<p>Up to the time of Virgil, and even later, the duties of
the workers in the hive were not properly understood.
It was not known even that the largest bee was really
the mother of them all, and that the workers looked
after and tended the eggs, which later on would develop
into young bees. In the days of Virgil it was supposed
that bees were born in flowers, or that if an ox was
killed and left to decay, a swarm of bees would be formed
in its body and could then be put into a hive. In the
Fourth Georgic very careful instructions are given by
Virgil as to how to prepare an ox for this purpose. Many
years ago this was translated into our language by a
bee-keeper, and the wording is so quaint that I think
you will be interested to read the following extract from
the curious directions. We are told that we must find
&#8220;a two-year-old bull calf, whose crooked horns be just
beginning to bud. The beaste, his nose-holes and breathing
are stopped, in spite of his much kicking! After he
hath been thumped to death, he is left in the place, and
under his sides are put bits of boughs and thyme and
fresh-plucked rosemarie. In time the warm humor beginneth<span class="pagenum" id="Page_47">[47]</span>
to ferment inside the soft bones of the carcase,
and wonderful to tell there appear creatures, footless at
first, but which soon getting unto themselves wings, mingle
together and buzz about, joying more and more in their
airy life. At last they burst forth, thick as raindroppes
from a summer cloude....&#8221;</p>

<p>The supposition that bees were obtained from a dead
ox lasted right down to the seventeenth century, and
there is no doubt that the Egyptians believed in this too,
for in some of their records we find that they buried
the body of an ox, leaving the horn-tips just above the
soil. After it had been left so for about a week, the tips
of the horns were sawn off, and a swarm of bees issued,
like smoke from a chimney. What a foolish idea this was,
just as though the body of an ox could, in any manner
imaginable, change into a swarm of bees! It probably
originated in the fact that the decaying body of an ox or
other animal quickly becomes surrounded by swarms of
flies, wasps, and other insects.</p>

<p>Up to the fifteenth and sixteenth centuries, the people
had no other substance than honey with which to sweeten
their food, for the mode of extracting the sweet juice
contained in the sugar-cane was not known till later.
Sugar-cane was actually discovered somewhere about
the first century <span class="allsmcap">A.D.</span> and a learned writer, Strabo by
name, has told how the chief admiral of the fleet of
Alexander the Great found what he called &#8220;a wonderful
honey-bearing reed,&#8221; whilst on a voyage of discovery
to India. It was not until the fifteenth century, however,
that the Spaniards set up a sugar plantation in Madeira,
and extracted the juice from the cane: even then it was<span class="pagenum" id="Page_48">[48]</span>
only the rich people who could afford the new luxury,
and others had still to use honey. From these remarks,
then, we can easily understand how necessary bees were
to the people, and how much depended on a good honey
year.</p>

<p>Besides using honey for sweetening purposes, the Anglo-Saxons
made from it a drink called Mead. You have
no doubt read of this in your history books, but perhaps
you did not know that it was made principally from
honey. Sometimes the juice of mulberries was added
to it, to give the drink a flavour, and it was then called
Morat. People who could afford to do so flavoured it
with spices, or sometimes even added wine, and in this
form it was used in the royal palace. In some country
places old-fashioned people still make and drink mead,
but it is very rarely heard of nowadays.</p>

<p>Bees also provided the ancients with wax, from which
a sort of candle was made, for in those times there was
no electricity or even gas, and so the people were very
glad to be able to use the wax for lighting purposes.
Nowadays, beeswax, mixed with a little turpentine, is
used for polishing furniture and oilcloth.</p>

THE HIVE</h2>
</div>

<p class="drop-cap">A HIVE may with all truth be called a bee-city, for
in it there live thousands upon thousands of little
workers. In this chapter I hope to tell you about the
actual construction of this wonderful city, so that you
may understand more easily the chapters that will
follow.</p>

<p>Hives used to be made of straw, and were called
&#8220;skeps.&#8221; Some of these skeps may still be seen in
country places, but they are rapidly being superseded by
the more convenient wooden hive. The two kinds are
shown in Plate XIV. The wooden hive is a kind of
box made in a special way, and it is usually painted white,
for this not only looks clean but also keeps out the heat
of the summer sun. You will notice that, like one of our
own houses, it is divided into three storeys. Close to
the floor of the hive, at the bottom of the lowest storey, is
the door, and this is made by cutting a slit in the wooden
wall. Two little slips of wood slide in front of it, so that
it can be made narrower, or even completely closed at the
wish of the bee-keeper. If the bees themselves wish to
close up the entrance for any reason, they are able to do
so by blocking it up with wax. The top chamber of all is<span class="pagenum" id="Page_50">[50]</span>
the roof, which is empty, and serves to protect the hive
from the rain. It must, of course, be lifted off by the bee-keeper
each time he wishes to look into the hive. The
second chamber is a sort of extra storehouse, and it is
used by the bees to store honey when the third chamber
is full. This third chamber is the most important of all,
for it is here that the bees live. It consists of rows upon
rows of combs, some of which are storeplaces for honey,
but the greater part form the nurseries where the young
bees are brought up.</p>

<p>All the cells are built of wax, no matter whether they
be honey cells or cradles, and they are constructed in
wooden frames which the bee-keeper places in the hive
for the purpose. In Plate XV. we see the roof and
the second chamber removed, exposing the inside of the
bottom chamber. The bee-man in the picture is lifting
out one of these frames of combs in order to examine it.
The frames are simply four pieces of wood, and are used
so that the bees may not fasten their combs to the walls
of the hive, for if this were done it would not be possible
for us to remove them from the hive. The number of
frames a hive contains depends on the size and prosperity
of the bee-city, and also on the particular time of the year.
If the city is a large one, and the inhabitants numerous,
there may be twelve or fourteen frames, each containing
thousands of separate cells. On the other hand, if the
bees are few, or suffering from any disease, the frames may
be reduced to half this number. Of course, the more
numerous the frames, the greater is the amount of work
to be done, and the more workers will be required to
attend to the young bees, and to the duties of the<span class="pagenum" id="Page_51">[51]</span>
hive. When all the frames are in position, they look
something like the picture in Plate XVI.</p>

<br />
Showing the Frames in Position</p>

<p>When we are examining a frame, we generally cover the
others over with a cloth, for the bees do not like the light
to penetrate their city. The frame having been replaced
and the second chamber put on, we cover all over with
thick pieces of felt to keep the hive warm, and on top
is placed the roof. The hive stands on four legs, a few
inches above the level of the ground, and the door is
generally sheltered by a kind of porch. In front of the
door there is a board which projects a few inches, and this
is called the alighting-board. On it the bees settle when
returning from the fields, and from it they commence their
flight when leaving the hive.</p>

A VISIT TO A HIVE</h2>
</div>

<p class="drop-cap2">LET us now imagine that we are to pay a visit to a
hive. If we are afraid of stings we may put on thick
leather gloves and tie our sleeves around the wrists, to
prevent any curious bee from investigating our arms.
Then over our hats we may place a veil, to keep the bees
from our face, for a sting in the eye would be a serious
matter. The bee-man in Plate XVII. is wearing a veil,
as you will see, and the brim of his straw hat is useful to
keep it at a little distance from his face, so that the bees
are not able to sting through it. Before we approach the
hive I must tell you one thing; if a bee flies around you
and comes rather closer to your face than you care about,
do not on any account hit it away. Bees, like some
human beings, are very curious by nature, and they like
to investigate anything strange that comes under their
notice. Never mind if one of them comes crawling over
your hand, or even if it steps inside your ear! It will not
hurt you if you keep still, but should you knock it away
with your hand, it will become angry, and probably you
will be stung there and then.</p>

<p class="top"><span class="smcap">Plate XVII</span></p>
<div class="figcenter"><img src="images/i_plate17.jpg" alt="" /></div>
<p class="caption">From a photograph by]  <span class="gap">    [E. Hawks</span><br />

<br />
Examining a Comb</p>

<p>Bees are very brave little creatures, and are frightened
of nothing in the world except smoke and the smell of<span class="pagenum" id="Page_53">[53]</span>
carbolic acid. When we wish to open the hive and to
examine the combs, we must first puff in a little smoke
at the door. Ordinary tobacco smoke would do quite
well, but we more often use a rolled-up piece of brown
paper, or some old rag, which are allowed to smoulder.
They are placed inside a tin, which is fixed to a pair of
bellows, and by working the bellows with our hand we
are able to puff out any quantity of smoke from the nozzle
with which the tin is fitted. This is done to frighten the
bees, and not to stupefy them, as most people think. As
soon as the smoke reaches them they rush to the storehouses
in order to take in provisions, for they think some
terrible calamity is about to occur. They know that they
would starve if they were forced to leave the hive without
a supply of food, and so by filling their honey-sacs they
provide themselves with food to last at least a day or two.
Though the bees are greatly frightened by the smoke, they
have no intention of deserting the city that they have built
with so much labour, unless it is absolutely necessary;
so after taking in supplies they wait to see what is going
to happen. While all this is going on we may look into
the hive and examine the combs, and after doing so the
roof is replaced, the smell of smoke leaves the hive, and
the bees settle down again. The honey in their honey-sacs
is put back into the storehouses, and work goes on
as usual throughout the bee-city.</p>

THE CITY GATE</h2>
</div>

<p class="drop-cap">THE door of the hive, or the city gate as it may be
called, always presents a busy spectacle, and Plate
XVIII. is a photograph of one. Bees are constantly alighting
on the board, coming so quickly that they appear to
spring from nowhere. Other bees come out of the gates,
and fly away quite as rapidly. Some even are in such a
hurry that they do not wait to crawl on to the board,
before taking to flight, but fly straight out of the door
and away into the blue. Then, again, others do not seem
to be in such a hurry, for they come out of the gates,
and stand on the board brushing down their wings,
seeming almost as though they were blinking in the bright
light of the morning sun. These are the young bees,
who are on their first expedition to gather honey; probably
they have never been outside the dark hive before,
and so they are unaccustomed to the strong light. They
must take careful survey of the position and surroundings
of the hive, so that they will be able to find it again
when returning laden with honey. The bees which dart
straight off from the hive door are the older workers, who
have made many a journey to and fro, and so know
very accurately the position of the hive.</p>

<br />
The City Gate</p>



<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_55">[55]</span>All these are the foragers, or honey gatherers, and it
is their business to visit hundreds of flowers over the
country side, and to extract from them, by the aid of
their wonderful tongues, the tiny drops of nectar. When
their honey-sac is full, they return to the hive with all
speed, and rushing inside, hand over the fruits of their
labours to the house bees. You will be surprised to
hear that a bee has to visit over 100 flowers before her
honey-sac is filled, and we must not forget that this tiny
sac when full holds only one-third of a drop. Now you will
understand what a great number of bees are required, and
how hard they have to work, in order to make 1 lb. of
honey. Yet some hives give more than 200 lbs. of honey
in a season! Just think of the vast amount of labour
and the incessant toil required for this result. But the
bees are always busy, and the proverb, &#8220;Go to the ant,
thou sluggard,&#8221; might be quite well changed to &#8220;bee,&#8221;
for I question whether the ant really works harder
than the bee. From the time that the first ray of the
morning sun strikes the dewy fields, until the sunset
merges into misty twilight, all is bustle and hurry in the
bee-city. So hard do the foragers work that instead of
living three or four years like the queen, they often live
only two or three weeks in the summer. In this short
time their wings become quite worn away, and their poor
little bodies are covered with wounds.</p>

<p>If we look carefully at the door of a hive on a warm
summer&#8217;s day, we shall no doubt see some of these poor
worn-out creatures. They can no longer take part in
the great work of the hive, and so for a short time they
come out into the sunshine and dodder about the alighting-board.<span class="pagenum" id="Page_56">[56]</span>
Their mission in life being over, no doubt
they will summon up all their remaining strength to fly
away to some quiet spot where they will die, unheeded
and unknown. Their last thought is to die somewhere
away from the hive, so that their bodies may not interfere
with the work of the city, and will not need others to
carry them to a burial-place. How sad it is to think of
these noble little workers, thousands upon thousands of
which out of each hive willingly give up their lives for the
great work of their race.</p>

<p>Besides the ever-busy foragers, there are other bees
coming and going who do not appear to be in such a
hurry. Each has two bright-coloured spots on her hind
legs. These bees are the pollen gatherers, who collect
the &#8220;bee-flour&#8221;; we might rightly call them the millers of
the hive, and a picture of them is shown in Plate XIX.</p>

<p>Some of the bees at the city gates are employed in
quite a different manner; they do not fly afar in search
of honey or pollen, but stand still, with heads pointing
to the hive door. They are using their wings so
vigorously that we cannot see them, just as the propeller
of an aeroplane is invisible, because it is turning so
quickly. These are the ventilating bees, whose duty it is
to keep the hive cool on hot days. The quick fanning
of their wings draws out the heated air from the hive, and
if we were able to peep inside the door we should see
other bees also engaged in the same occupation. These,
too, stand with their heads towards the hive door, but
instead of fanning out the hot air, as the outside bees do,
they draw a stream of pure, cool air into the hive. By
this simple and wonderful arrangement the bees are able<span class="pagenum" id="Page_57">[57]</span>
to regulate the temperature to a nicety, for if it grows
too warm, they have only to set more fanners to work,
to expel the hot air. The temperature of the hive is a
very important matter, for should it become too high
the young ones would be suffocated, whilst if it dropped
too low they would be starved to death.</p>

<div class="figcenter"><img src="images/i_plate19.jpg" alt="" /></div>
<p class="caption">Pollen gathers at Hive Door</p>

<p>The fanning is very hard work, and so, if we watch, we
see that as a bee grows tired her place is taken by a fresh
worker, and so the ventilating is constantly kept up.</p>

<p>During the hot nights of summer, in the busiest time,
the hive is thronged with workers who have come home
from the fields to shelter from the dew and cold of the
night. The city then becomes very crowded and hot, and
a large army of bees must be kept at work ventilating. If,
on such a night, we were to steal down to the hive with a
lighted candle and place it a few inches from the door, the
draught caused by the fanners would be quite strong
enough to blow out the flame!</p>

THE GUARD BEES</h2>
</div>

<p class="drop-cap">IF we watch for a short time at the city gates, we shall
very likely see two bees apparently fighting desperately.
If we look closely we may see that one of the bees has hold
of the other by the wing, and is dragging it away from the
door. To and fro the fight rages, and the bee which is
held struggles fiercely, but without avail, for the other has
her in a firm grip. The captive bee is really a robber,
which has been caught whilst trying to slip into the hive to
steal honey. It may be that the robber is from another
hive, or perhaps is a wild bee, for there are communities of
bees which are really like pirates. They have their homes
in some hollow tree, and live either by robbing other cities,
or by waylaying workers on their return from the fields,
and taking from them the honey which they have so
laboriously gathered. The bees, therefore, have found it
very necessary that there should be a guard at the gates of
their cities, and there are always some soldier bees on
sentry-go.</p>

<p>To us, no doubt, one bee looks very much like another,
and it is a mystery how the guards are able to recognise a
strange bee. It is probable that the sense of smell has a
great deal to do with this, for it is thought that all the bees<span class="pagenum" id="Page_59">[59]</span>
of one hive smell alike, but differently from those of
another hive, and that by this means the guards may
detect a robber. A strange bee is never allowed to cross
the threshold unless it is perhaps in the busy season, when
the bees are &#8220;working overtime&#8221; as we might say, straining
every nerve and muscle to gather in as much honey as they
can before the summer goes and the flowers die. Then if
a stranger comes to the hive, with her honey-sac full of the
precious fluid, she may be allowed to pass in. Wasps
often try to gain an entrance, as also do many other insects
of one sort or another. If we watch the door for quite a
short time in summer, it is pretty certain that we shall see
several struggles. Sometimes it takes two or even three
bees to expel the intruder.</p>

<p>On one occasion I witnessed a fight which lasted well
over half-an-hour between a robber bee and a guard bee.
They rolled over and over on the board, this way and that,
each trying to get the better of the other. At last they fell
on to the ground below, but even then they did not stop
the fight, and the struggle continued on the grass.
Eventually the guard bee won the day, and by what
appeared to be a final effort, she managed to pierce the
abdomen of the robber bee with her sting. Instantly the
robber bee was killed, and the brave little soldier bee
returned to the hive in triumph.</p>

<p>It is not easy for one bee to sting another, for the
abdomen and thorax are so hard that it can only be done
through one of the rings of the abdomen, where the skin is
thin.</p>

WORKERS IN THE CITY</h2>
</div>

<p class="drop-cap">BESIDES the fanners, the foragers, and the guards,
there are other classes of bees at work in the hive.
There are, for instance, the scavengers and cleaners-up,
whose duty it is to keep the city and the combs spotlessly
clean. Little twigs, dead leaves, and bits of gravel are all
removed by these bees. Sometimes a mouse or a snail
enters the hive, and then indeed there is great excitement.
Imagine a great elephant-like creature, thirty or forty feet
high, with a tail thirty feet long, to come walking into one
of our cities, and you will have some idea what it seems
like to the bees when a mouse is foolish enough to poke
its head into the hive! But the bees are not frightened;
the guards are promptly called out, and the poor mouse
is soon put to death by hundreds of stings. Having made
sure that the intruder is quite dead, the bees leave his
body to the scavengers, who are confronted with the
problem of disposing of it. If it were left it would cause
disease and pestilence throughout the city, and it is too
big and heavy for them to move. It is true that they
might bite it into tiny pieces and thus carry it outside the
hive, but this would take too much of the bees&#8217; valuable
time. A better plan is thought of, and the body is soon<span class="pagenum" id="Page_61">[61]</span>
covered over with a thin coating of wax. It is thus embalmed
in a beautiful white tomb, which is made perfectly
air-tight. If the tomb is near to the door, and interferes
with the passing in and out of the workers, tunnels are cut
through it. Sometimes when we look inside a hive, we
may see two or three of these little mounds of wax, and
we may be sure that each one is the grave of some intruder
who had no right to be there.</p>

<p>Then there are the undertakers, who have a grim duty
to perform. They carry away the bodies of workers who
may have died within the hive, and in winter they have a
busy time. It has been said, with what truth we do not
know, that each hive has a burial-ground where the bodies
of its workers are placed. It may be behind some bush
in a corner of the garden, or perhaps down by the willows
which fringe the banks of the stream. Whether this is so
or not, it is certain that the undertakers carry the bodies
of the dead bees away from the hive, so that they shall not
pollute the pure air of the city and so cause disease. Now
and then as we watch we may see one of these undertakers
carrying what looks like the ghost of a bee! It is a bee
in form, but its wings are folded, and its body is not a
beautiful brown, but pearly white. This is a young bee,
which has died before its birth, in the cell which has been
both its cradle and its tomb. In winter, when it is too
cold for the undertakers to journey far with their gruesome
burdens, they will drop them just over the alighting-board,
and so we sometimes see the ground near a hive strewn
with dead bees, for many die during the colder months.</p>

<p>The water carriers are the bees who fly backwards and
forwards between some neighbouring stream and the hive,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_62">[62]</span>
supplying it with the water necessary to the workers. A
hive should be placed near a stream or river, so that the
bees may have as much water as they want, and they are
helped in this if the stream be a shallow one in which
there are little pebbles and rocks so that they can easily sip
up the water. Another class of workers are the chemists,
whose duty it is to place a tiny drop of acid, from their
poison-bag, into each cell of honey, before it is finally
sealed over. The acid supplied is chiefly what is called
formic acid, and this is a very good preservative; it serves
to keep the honey fresh and sweet until it is wanted.</p>

<p>You will remember that we said that it was actually good
for us to be stung. This is because the formic acid which
is pumped into the wound by the bee mixes with our blood,
and prevents rheumatism. You will hardly ever find that a
bee-keeper is troubled with this complaint.</p>

THE COMB BUILDERS</h2>
</div>

<p class="drop-cap">IN order to trace the history of a hive, and to learn
about the round of work which goes on day by day, we
will suppose that a swarm of bees has been placed in an
empty hive. We shall then be able to follow them as they
commence with the first necessary work of building the
combs. Our later chapters will lead us through the whole
cycle of hive life.</p>

<p>We have already seen how the frames are placed within
the hive, but we have yet to learn how the combs are built
in them. Before the builders can set to work, however,
it is necessary that the wax, of which the combs are constructed,
should be made.</p>

<p>When a swarm of bees first enters the empty hive,
numbers of them climb to the roof, and fasten themselves,
by means of their tiny claws, to points of vantage. Other
bees then join them, each hooking its claws in the claws
of another, and in this manner chains of living bees hang
from the roof in festoons. As time goes on these chains
become more numerous, until the hanging bees look like
a large cluster, for the chains cross and intertwine. All
the bees do not form themselves into chains, for guards
are posted at the hive door, while others examine every<span class="pagenum" id="Page_64">[64]</span>
corner of their new home. The scavengers have to clean
the floor and carry away twigs or gravel, so that everything
shall be perfectly tidy for the builders to start work.</p>

<p>Now commences that wonderful and mysterious process
of wax forming, which is carried on in perfect silence by
the cluster of hanging bees. You will remember that the
abdomen of the worker is composed of six rings; underneath
these are the eight wax-pockets. There are two
in each ring except in the first and last. It is perhaps
interesting to note that the queen and the drone have no
wax-pockets because they do not take part in the making
of wax. For a similar reason their legs are not furnished
with wax-pincers, like those of the worker. As the bees
hang from the roof of the hive, in solemn and impressive
silence, tiny scales are to be seen protruding from the wax-pockets.
They look almost like a letter which has been
pushed half-way into the slot of a pillar-box. A wax-pocket
produces one wax scale, and so the workers each
make eight tiny pieces of wax. In order that wax may
be made in this manner it is necessary for the bees to
consume a large quantity of honey, 10 or 15 lbs. of which
produces only 1 lb. of wax.</p>

<p>We have already seen that the hind leg of the worker is
provided with a set of wax-pincers (see Plate X.), and
when the tiny scale of wax has been formed, these pincers
take hold of it and remove it from the pocket. By means
of the front legs it is then passed to the mouth, and here
the strong little jaws come in useful. In its present state
the wax is hard and rough, and it must be made smooth
and pliable. It is mixed with juices supplied by glands in
the bee&#8217;s mouth, and worked by the jaws until it is so soft<span class="pagenum" id="Page_65">[65]</span>
that it can be moulded into any desired shape. Often,
when wax is being made, the floor of the hive becomes
covered with wax plates which have fallen from the cluster
above. When the wax has been kneaded to the correct
degree of softness, the worker will leave the cluster of
hanging bees, and crawl to the highest part of the roof of
the hive. This is the foundation-stone of the combs, for
they are not built upwards from the ground as our houses
are, but downwards from the roof.</p>

<br />
Queen Cells on Comb</p>

<p>When the first plate of wax is in position, the little
worker will take the other plates one by one from her wax-pockets,
and knead them as she did the first. Each in
turn will be placed on the foundation, and then the bee
will again join the cluster. Immediately she disappears,
however, her place will be taken by another, who goes
through exactly the same process. She in turn will be
followed by another, and so on, until a small piece of
beautiful white wax hangs from the roof. At this stage
it is time for the architects to plan out the position and
shape of the first cells, which are to be sculptured out of
the wax. If we watch, we may see one of these bees
appear, and it is evident that she knows exactly what to
do, and just what shape the first cell is to be. She moulds
the unformed wax by means of her jaws, and very soon
the outline of the cell is seen. It is hollowed out, and the
wax removed in this process is carefully placed so as to
form the walls. Meanwhile, another architect has been
doing a similar thing on the opposite side of the piece
of wax, for the cells are built back to back, as by this
arrangement there is a saving of material. The wax-makers
continue to add more and more wax, the sculptors<span class="pagenum" id="Page_66">[66]</span>
go on with their work, and soon the form of the comb
becomes apparent.</p>

<div class="figleft"><img src="images/i_066.jpg" alt="" /><p class="caption">CRADLE CELLS.</p></div>

<div class="figright"><img src="images/i_067.jpg" alt="" /><p class="caption">HONEY CELLS.</p></div>

<p>I suppose every one knows that bee cells are hexagonal,
or six-sided. If they were made circular, you can easily
understand that there would be a great deal of space and
material wasted, for the spaces between the cells would
need to be filled up. Then, again, if they were made
diamond-shaped, there would still be
places to fill in. It is true they might
be made four-sided, but apart from the
fact that such cells would not be strong
enough, it is not possible for them to
be made thus, for the angles would
be too great for the bees to get their
jaws into the corners. It has been found
that six-sided cells are the strongest
and the most economical, but how the
bees found this out, too, is a mystery.</p>



<p>There are three kinds of bee cells:
firstly the cradle cells, in which the
young bees are reared. They are <sup><small>1</small></sup>&frasl;<sub><small>2</small></sub>
inch deep and <sup><small>1</small></sup>&frasl;<sub><small>5</small></sub>th inch in diameter.
There will therefore be about twenty-eight in a square inch
of comb, but as the drone is slightly larger than the worker,
his cradle must be bigger. We find accordingly that the
drone cells are <sup><small>1</small></sup>&frasl;<sub><small>4</small></sub>th inch in diameter, or about eighteen to
the square inch.</p>

<p>Then there are the royal cells, which are altogether different.
In them the young queens are reared, and in
appearance they are something like acorn cups. In Plate
XX. you see a picture of a frame of comb, taken from<span class="pagenum" id="Page_67">[67]</span>
the hive with the bees still on it. The bee-man is pointing
to two of these queen cells, and you will see that they
hang downwards, in a place where the ordinary comb has
been cut away to make room for them.</p>

<p>Lastly there are the honey cells, which are of the same
size as the cradle cells, but instead of being built horizontal
they are made sloping upwards. By constructing them in
this way honey stored in them is prevented
from running out over the combs.</p>




<p>The back of the cells, or the dividing
wall between the two sets, is not flat, as
we might imagine. If you look at the
sketches you will see that the cells are
fitted into one another so cleverly that
the bottom of one cell forms half of
the bottoms of two cells of the other side
of the comb. All the cells of one sort,
say for instance the honey cells, are
made exactly the same size, and do not
differ by the fraction of an inch. How
the bees are able to measure the width
when building them is a mystery. Perhaps the antenn&aelig;
have some important part to play in this matter, but if so
it has yet to be discovered. Another thing which is as
curious as it is mysterious is how the sculptors on each
side of the comb are able to fit in the cells so neatly that
each one is in its right place with regard to the cells on
the other side of the dividing wall. It is certain that the
workers cannot see through the wall of wax, and yet the
two lots of cells correspond exactly.</p>

THE LIFE OF THE BEE</h2>
</div>

<p class="drop-cap2">ALL the time the cells are being built the queen wanders
about the hive in a distracted fashion, because there
are no cells ready for her to fill. Now that some are ready,
however, her movements change. Surrounded by her
councillors, or ladies-in-waiting, as we might call them,
she clambers over the comb and selects a cell in which to
lay the first egg. She very carefully examines the cell by
placing her head in it and feeling the sides with her
antenn&aelig;. Being satisfied that it is in a fit state to become
the cradle of a young bee, she withdraws her head and
then the egg is laid. All this time the ladies-in-waiting
stand round, and in the season for egg-laying you may
quickly pick out the queen by the circle of bees about her
(see Plate III.). They guide her over the comb, feed and
clean her; sometimes, too, we may see them stroking her
very tenderly with their antenn&aelig;. After the first egg is
deposited in the cell, the queen moves to the next, and so
on all through the summer. During this time she lays day
and night, and does not appear to sleep.</p>

<p>The eggs are little pearly-looking objects something like
tiny rice grains, and each one is fastened to its cell by a
drop of gummy liquid.</p>

<p>In the meantime the bees are at work building combs<span class="pagenum" id="Page_69">[69]</span>
with all haste, for the queen is close on their heels, demanding
more and more cells. She does not rest until
the whole of the ten or twelve frames have been completely
filled with cells and eggs. By this time the first eggs
which were laid will have hatched out into young bees,
who will leave their cradles to take part in the duties of
the hive. These first cells will then be cleaned out by the
scavengers, and the queen will lay more eggs in them. In
this way the queen goes on all the summer, and as a matter
of fact, if the hive be a prosperous one, she may lay as
many as 3000 eggs each day! After the eggs have been
laid the queen does not appear to take the slightest interest
in what may become of them. On the other hand, the
worker bees do, for they know that on these tiny little eggs
depends the future of the hive.</p>

<p>In three or four days an egg will hatch into a tiny
white grub, which the nurse bees immediately commence
to feed. It is not fed upon honey, though, for that
would be like feeding a baby on roast beef! The nurse
bees have certain glands in their bodies by which they are
able to turn honey into a kind of bee-milk, and this is
called &#8220;chyle food.&#8221; For three days the little grub is
carefully fed upon this preparation, and then it is given
&#8220;modified chyle food,&#8221; as it is called, which is also bee-milk,
but richer than before. During these few days the
grub casts its skin and grows very quickly, until on the
fifth day it turns into a chrysalis, just as a caterpillar does
before becoming a butterfly. The bee-grub spins a soft
silken cocoon, and the sculptor bees come along and seal
over the mouth of the cell with a cover, which admits air
so that the grub may breathe.</p>



<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_70">[70]</span>The grub then commences what is called its <i>metamorphosis</i>&mdash;a
Greek word meaning &#8220;a change of form&#8221;&mdash;and
a wonderful change it is. In sixteen days from the time
that the cell was closed up, the fat little grub turns into
a perfect worker, just like a caterpillar changes into a
butterfly. The young bee is now ready to emerge from
her cell, and the porous capping is the only barrier. The
little prisoner, however, finds that she has a sharp pair
of jaws and so begins to bite the capping. Slowly it is all
snipped away, and we see a tiny hole appear, which grows
larger and larger. In a few moments out comes one of the
antenn&aelig;, and waves about as though to explore the world
beyond the cell. It seems to give a good report to the
little bee, for the biting of the cap is redoubled, and before
long, assisted perhaps by some of the nurse bees, the
youngster slowly emerges. She is, however, very pale and
weak as yet, and so the nurse bees commence to clean and
feed her. She soon gains sufficient strength to take an
interest in what is going on around, and we may imagine
that she is somewhat surprised to find how busy is the city
into which she has stepped&mdash;every one rushing here, there,
and all over, none seeming to take any notice of the young
bee, and everybody apparently having something to do,
and to be in a great hurry to do it!</p>

<p>A fortunate insect is the little bee, none the less; for she
has no need to attend school or to have any lessons. She
knows all that she need know as soon as she is born. In
a few hours&#8217; time, for instance, she will be feeding grubs,
just as she was fed by other bees some days before. She
will know all about the city, the duties which she has to
perform, and the respect which she must pay to the queen,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_71">[71]</span>
her mother. After perhaps a fortnight or so of nurses&#8217; work
she will join the ranks of the foragers, and seek the nectar
of the sweet-scented flowers.</p>

Queen Cells</p>

<p>This, then, is the history of the birth of a worker bee, of
which a prosperous hive may contain anything from 30,000
to 60,000. The history of the birth of a drone is practically
the same, except that in his case it takes twenty-five
days for the egg to change into the complete insect.</p>

THE STORY OF THE QUEEN</h2>
</div>

<p class="drop-cap2">AMONG most nations it is customary for the kingship
to be handed down from father to son, but no such
rule exists in the bee-city. Although we call one of the
bees the Queen, she is not really a queen in the ordinary
sense of the word. She does not rule the hive, nor can she
command the bees to do this thing or that, and a far better
name for her would be the Mother bee.</p>

<p>Up to the seventeenth century it was thought that a hive
was ruled over by a king-bee, and it was not known that
this large bee was the mother of all the other bees, and yet
this is so, as we have already seen. Whether or not a queen
shall be born depends on the wish of the workers, and it is
surprising to find that a queen is developed from an ordinary
egg, which, if it were not subjected to certain different
processes, would turn into a worker bee.</p>

<p class="top"><span class="smcap">Plate XXII</span></p>
<div class="figcenter"><img src="images/i_plate22.jpg" alt="" /></div>
<p class="caption">From a photograph by] <span class="gap">     [E. Hawks</span><br />

<br />
An Empty Queen Cell</p>

<p>When the bees desire that a queen shall be born, the
builders and sculptors are first consulted. They set to
work to make three or four queen cells, or, as we might call
them, royal cradles; in one of them the future queen will
be reared. We have already seen that queen cells are
different from the ordinary cells, and that for their accommodation
a part of the comb is cut away. This gives<span class="pagenum" id="Page_73">[73]</span>
better ventilation, and the royal cells hang downwards
from the comb as seen in Plate XXI. The nurse bees now
place in the first an egg from one of the worker cells, but
this egg must not be more than three days old, otherwise a
queen would not be produced, no matter what efforts the
bees might make. Eggs are placed in the other cells at
intervals of three days. On the fourth day the first egg
hatches into a grub, just as it did in the case of the worker
bee, whose career it resembles up to this stage. But now
the nurse bees, instead of feeding it upon chyle food,
commence to supply it with &#8220;royal jelly&#8221; as it is called.
This is a very rich form of food, and is only given to those
grubs which it is intended shall become queens. The nurse
bees continue to pay special attention to the little grub,
and give it as much of the royal jelly as it can take. This
goes on until the ninth day, when the grub spins a cocoon
and the cell is closed up. On the sixteenth day from the
time the egg was laid the young princess will be ready to
leave her cell; she will then commence to gnaw the floor
in order that she may get out. In Plate XXII. there is
shown an empty queen cell, the floor of which has been cut
away in this manner.</p>

<p>Thus we see that the making of the queen rests entirely
with the workers themselves, and depends simply on an
egg being placed in a certain kind of cell, and having
special food and plenty of ventilation. After the queen has
been hatched, the royal cell is cut away, and its place
filled with honey cells. The wax of the cell is not
wasted, but used in the construction of new comb.</p>

THE POLLEN GATHERERS</h2>
</div>

<p class="drop-cap2">LET us now follow one of the pollen-gathering bees
on her quest of bee-flour, which is so necessary for
feeding the inhabitants of the hive. Having first taken
a careful survey of the position of the hive and its surroundings,
our little worker flies off at top speed to the
hillside or the orchards where, it may be, the fruit trees
are in full bloom. On her way, perhaps, she will decide
what kind of pollen is to be gathered, for different kinds
of pollen are kept quite separate, just as our own flours
are separated. It remains a mystery why bees should
keep the different pollens apart, as it seems to us that it
would not matter much if they were mixed, but no doubt
the bees know better than we do. Although buttercups
may be scarce, and though the hedges are laden with
hawthorn blossom, yet if the gathering bee has started to
collect buttercup pollen, she will pass by the hawthorn
and search diligently for buttercups in the adjoining
meadows.</p>

<p class="top"><span class="smcap">Plate XXIII</span></p>

<div class="figcenter"><img src="images/i_plate23.jpg" alt="" /></div>
<p class="caption">Storing the pollen in cells</p>

<p>Arriving at the flower, the little worker alights and
moves about it, so that very soon her hairy body
becomes covered with pollen, as shown in the <i>frontispiece</i>.
Although she was a brown bee when she alighted on the
flower, now she is all golden yellow, and looks like a<span class="pagenum" id="Page_75">[75]</span>
dusty miller. It is here that the brushes and combs
with which the legs are furnished come in useful, and
after two or three flowers have been visited, we may see
her brushing down her body, and combing the pollen
grains out of the hairs in which they are entangled. The
collected pollen is then moistened with a tiny drop of
honey, and kneaded into little round pellets, which are
placed in the pollen baskets. This being done, the bee
flies on and on, visiting other flowers, until her baskets
are quite full. Sometimes the bee gathers more than
can be carried in her baskets, so she returns to the hive
with her body smothered in gaily-coloured pollen.</p>

<p>Though her wings are strong, yet the load of pollen is
heavy, and all her strength is needed to reach the hive in
safety. It may be that she is almost exhausted before
she can alight on the board at the city gates. So she will
settle on a leaf or some flower, like a ship coming to
anchor, in the harbour of the garden, and here for a few
seconds she will rest, to gain fresh strength for the final
flight. Some of the bees seem to act as inspectors, or
general helpers as it were, always on the lookout to do
somebody a good turn or to lend a helping hand wherever
it may be required. And now, as the pollen gatherer
makes a final flight to the board, these bees come forward
and help her to drag her load safely within the city.
Once inside the door, the worker makes straight for the
cells which might be called the flour bins, for here the
pollen is stored. A picture of them is to be seen in
Plate XXIII., and you will notice that the different kinds
of pollen are still kept separate. Arrived here, the gatherer
levers the pellets out of the baskets by means of the
spurs on each of her middle legs. These act as little<span class="pagenum" id="Page_76">[76]</span>
crowbars, and the pollen is then placed in the cells. If
it is not intended for immediate use, some of the house
bees will cover it over with a layer of honey, for it
would not keep if left exposed to the air. We should
imagine that the pollen gatherer would now take a rest,
or at any rate some refreshment. This, however, is not
the case, for no sooner has she got rid of her load than
she darts towards the door, and before we have time to
follow her she is off to the fields again for another load.
From morning to night she continues to travel backwards
and forwards between the flowers and the hive. Is it
any wonder, then, that at the end of a few weeks&#8217; time
the brave little worker will have completely worn away
her wings, and will lie down and die?</p>

<p>When watching the alighting-board, you will remember
that we remarked on the pollen gatherers entering the hive,
each with the little baskets filled with bright-coloured
pollen; from the colour of the pollen we may tell from
what flowers the bees have brought it. The deep golden-brown
comes from the gorse bloom, away on the hill; the
snow-white from the hawthorn, and the vivid yellow from
the buttercup, or perhaps the dandelion. The pale green
is from the gooseberry bushes, whilst the pollen of the
charlock is golden and clover pollen is russet-brown.
Sometimes, when the poppies are growing among the corn,
the little gatherers will return with loads of jet-black pollen,
while the orchards give many delicate hues, the most
beautiful of which is the light yellow from the apple
blossom. On rare occasions, we may see a worker come
laden with pollen of deep crimson, but the source of this
wonderfully coloured stuff is a mystery, for we do not know
from what flower it is obtained.</p>

THE VARNISH MAKERS</h2>
</div>

<p class="drop-cap">SOME people think that bees gather only honey and
pollen, but there is another substance which they
collect, and this is called &#8220;propolis.&#8221; The poplar and
pine trees have, as perhaps you know, a resinous kind of
matter covering their new shoots, whilst the horse-chestnut
protects its leaf buds with a similar sticky substance.
This the bees gather, and they draw it off the trees in thin
strings, just as sometimes you see children playing with a
piece of sticky toffee, by pulling it into two pieces. The
bees then roll these strings into balls, and pack them in
their pollen baskets, and return to the hive. The other
bees help to unload as soon as the gatherers arrive, for
the sticky substance soon hardens, and must therefore be
got out of the pollen baskets as quickly as possible, and for
the same reason it must be used at once. The bees then
knead it with their jaws and mix with it some liquid from
their mouths, until it is quite soft and pliable.</p>

<p>With this preparation, which is really like varnish, the
bees coat the whole of the inside walls if the hive is a new
one. Should there be any cracks in the walls or floor, they
are carefully filled up to keep out the cold and damp.
Then again the propolis, in a stronger form, is used for<span class="pagenum" id="Page_78">[78]</span>
fastening the combs to the frames, and for any other
objects which the little engineers may think need firmly
fixing. When we open a hive we find that the felts, which
cover the combs and keep them warm, are firmly fastened
down to the frames, and sometimes we have to use considerable
force to get them off. The frames holding the combs
are fastened into position, too, with propolis, and a
mixture of this substance and wax is used to cover over
the bodies of any intruders who have entered the hive and
have been stung to death. The combs containing sealed
cells of honey are subjected to a coating of very thin
propolis to keep them sweet and clean. Plate XXIV. is a
photograph of a frame of comb just removed from the hive.
Towards the top you will see bees busy capping the honey
cells, and others are varnishing them over with propolis.
The cells inside the white lines are pollen cells, and you
may see pollen-pellets in them.</p>

THE NECTAR GATHERERS</h2>
</div>

<p class="drop-cap">IN this chapter I propose to relate to you the day&#8217;s work
of a nectar gatherer, or forager. These are perhaps
the most important workers in the hive. If you look it
up in your dictionary you will find that nectar is described
as being &#8220;any pleasant liquid.&#8221; I want you to understand
that the bees do not actually gather what we call honey.
What the bees gather, and what the flowers secrete, is
nectar, which is a thin watery liquid, containing among
other things a large proportion of cane sugar.</p>

<p>Arrived at the meadow the forager alights on the first
suitable flower she comes to, and dips her tongue down to
the nectaries. Even the tiniest droplet of nectar can be
collected by means of the spoon at the tip of the proboscis.
She visits flower after flower until her honey-sac is filled,
and then she sets out on the return journey to the hive.
Whilst she flies a change takes place within the honey-sac.
First of all the nectar is strained, to separate the pollen,
and in the manner we have already seen. Then some
juices are added to it which are supplied by glands in the
bee&#8217;s body. The cane sugar is changed into another form,
called grape sugar.</p>

<p>Cane sugar is not good for either us or animals to eat,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_80">[80]</span>
but on the other hand grape sugar is beneficial. You will
know that we cannot derive any nourishment from our
food until it has been acted upon by the saliva of the
mouth and by certain juices in the stomach. The food
is then said to be digested. Practically the same change
is carried out in the bee&#8217;s body, the nectar being converted
into honey. In her case, however, the change is not made
only upon the food she consumes herself, but also on that
contained in the honey-sac. Many people think that the
honey they eat is just in the same state as it is in the
nectaries of the flowers from which it has been gathered,
but now you will know that this is not so. The reason
that honey is good for us is that it has already been partly
digested by the bees, and therefore our stomach is saved
a certain amount of work.</p>

<p>Our bee has now arrived at the hive, and as she passes
the guard bees she is recognised as being one of themselves,
and her entry to the hive is not delayed. The
guards may salute her as she passes, with a wave of their
antenn&aelig;, and she hurries off to the storehouses. Here
the warehouse bees are kept busy storing away the honey
brought in by the foragers, and to one of these bees our
little friend hands over her load. At least she does not
&#8220;hand&#8221; it over, but passes it from her tongue to that of
the other bee, who in turn swallows it. This bee then
climbs to the cell she is filling, and placing her tongue
therein, empties the honey into it. No sooner has the
forager been relieved of her load than she makes her way
to the hive door, pushing and struggling, butting with her
head here, or crawling over her sisters there, until she at
last forces her way through the crowd and flies off to gather<span class="pagenum" id="Page_81">[81]</span>
further supplies. A bee that is one day gathering nectar
will probably collect pollen the next day, and <i>vice versa</i>.
By this arrangement the organs which change the nectar
into honey are given a rest.</p>

<p>We cannot tell how bees are able to find their way
home to the hive so cleverly. They may fly two, three,
four, or even more miles away to the flowers, but they are
always able to return. If a forager bee is imprisoned in
a box, and carried a couple of miles away and released,
she will reach the hive long before we could; in this
respect you will see that bees are something like homing
pigeons.</p>

THE WINTER SLEEP</h2>
</div>

<p class="drop-cap">DURING the summer the bees work only with the
idea of storing away sufficient honey to last them
during the dark days of winter, when there are no flowers.
In the tropics, where perpetual summer reigns, the bees
live as it were from hand to mouth, and do not store
nearly so much honey as those bees which live in climes
where the summer is followed by a long winter.</p>

<p>When autumn comes, and the flowers vanish, the bees
gather round the queen on the combs of the hive; we see
some of them in Plate XXV. The builders block up the
doorway with wax until only a narrow passage is left, just
large enough to allow them to travel in and out. This is
done to keep out the cold of winter, for then it is necessary
for the temperature inside the hive to be as high as
possible.</p>

<p>In this cluster the bees pass the winter in a kind of sleep.
They eat the honey which they have stored, and wait for
the arrival of spring. The outermost bees of the cluster
are of course the coldest, and so that each may take a turn
at being on the outside, they constantly change places.
They only leave the hive on a few occasions during this
time, and then it is to take a short flight for exercise.</p>

<br />
Bees clustering in Winter</p>



<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_83">[83]</span>When the bright sunshine comes, and the crocuses tell
of the coming of spring, the bees begin to bestir themselves.
Sometimes when it has been snowing, and the snow is
lying on the ground, the bees are deceived by the glare
into thinking that spring has come; they fly out to look
for flowers, but many of them are killed by the cold.
When spring is actually at hand, however, the pollen
gatherers are despatched to the crocuses and other early
flowers. They come back laden with pollen, and as soon
as the queen bee sees this she commences to lay. These
eggs will develop into the bees which will carry on the
work of the hive during the summer. The bees which
have slept through the winter only live long enough to look
after these eggs, and to bring the young bees safely into the
world.</p>

<p>It is interesting to note that the amount of nectar and
pollen gathered will, to a certain extent, regulate the
number of eggs that the queen will lay. If food is scarce
she will not lay many, for if she did a great number would
have no food and all would die of starvation. If, on the
other hand, honey and pollen are abundant, hundreds or
even thousands of eggs will be laid in a single day.
The number is increased, too, as spring merges into
summer, and for a fortnight or three weeks in May or June,
the hive is at its busiest. During this period the fields are
white with clover, and the flowers are at their best. This
time is known as the honey flow, and if the hive be a
prosperous one, the honey does literally flow into the
combs.</p>

THE SWARM</h2>
</div>

<p class="drop-cap">IT is not known exactly why bees swarm, and it has
been said that it is because the hive becomes overpopulated.
When the hive becomes crowded early in the
summer, the bees build queen cells, and in them royal
princesses are reared, as we have already seen. When the
time approaches for them to leave the cells, the old queen
begins to get very excited, for she seems to know that a
rival is about to be born. She would like to rush to the
cells and put the young princesses to death, and indeed
she would do this, were not the cells guarded by the other
bees, who anticipate trouble with the old queen. So,
though she may make the attempt, after being repulsed
time after time she will give up, and adopt another procedure.
She seems to realise that her rule in the hive is
at an end, and so she determines to leave it on the first
fine day, with as many of the other bees as will accompany
her, and to fly to pastures new. All is then commotion
with the bees that will go with her, and they seem to
eagerly await the signal to be off. No one knows how it is
decided which bees shall go, or which shall remain, for old
or young, builders or foragers, may go or stay. All who
are going, however, take in supplies of honey, and when<span class="pagenum" id="Page_85">[85]</span>
the appointed time has arrived the swarm issues from the
door of the hive in a thick black stream. The old queen
will be among them, and they generally fly to some tree
close at hand. A suitable spot is chosen, on one of the
branches perhaps, and the leading bees settle there. These
are quickly joined by the others, so that in a few seconds
the cluster is as large as an orange. It grows larger and
larger, until after a few minutes from the time the bees left
the hive in a mad throng, they will all be quietly hanging
in a pear-shaped mass like those in Plate XXVI.</p>

<p class="top"><span class="smcap">Plate XXVI</span></p>
<div class="figcenter"><img src="images/i_plate26.jpg" alt="" /></div>
<p class="caption">From a photograph by]<span class="gap">      [W. Dixon</span><br />

<br />
A Swarm</p>

<p>A swarm is a wonderful sight, for the bees are almost
perfectly still, and hang in a glistening mass, clinging to
one another by their tiny hooked claws. Sometimes the
leading bees of a swarm choose queer places in which to
cluster: one lot, for instance, swarmed on to the beard of
a gardener, whilst another found a resting-place on the
neck of a horse which was standing under some trees!</p>

<p>As soon as the bees have swarmed on the branch, or
wherever they may have settled, scouts are sent out to
look for a suitable place for the new home. They return
with news of some spot which they think would serve the
purpose. This scout thinks that the hollow tree she has
found would be best, but another says that a little cave in
the rocks would be better. Meanwhile more scouts are
despatched, and when all the different proposals have been
considered, and all possible places discussed, it is finally
settled where the future home shall be. Headed by the
scouts, who now act as guides, the swarm then takes to
flight once more, and will not stop until it reaches the
chosen spot. Wherever or whatever it may be matters
not, for the bees will have to commence at the very<span class="pagenum" id="Page_86">[86]</span>
beginning of the cycle of home life, and as soon as they
are all inside the new home the wax-makers will climb to
the highest points, hang in chains, and begin to make
the wax for the combs, exactly as we saw in a previous
chapter.</p>

TAKING THE SWARM</h2>
</div>

<p class="drop-cap">BEE-KEEPERS watch for the issuing of the swarm,
and when it occurs they get ready to take it, so as to
fill another hive with bees. Having found where the bees
are hanging, an empty hive is brought to the spot and
placed under the branch. The bees are then shaken into
it, or they may be even gathered in handfuls, or with a
spoon, and placed in the new hive (see Plate XXVII.).
At the time of swarming bees are practically harmless, for
they have taken so much honey that they do not feel disposed
to sting. The old straw skeps are often used for
taking a swarm, for they may be more conveniently handled
than the larger and heavier wooden hives. The hive which
is to be their permanent home is placed close at hand too,
with a clean white cloth on a board leading to the door in
front of it. After the bees have been shaken into the skep
they are emptied on to the cloth, and at once commence
to walk into their new home (Plate XXVIII.). There are
thousands upon thousands of bees in a swarm, and pictures
of them going into new hives are shown on Plates XXIX.
and XXX. In order to show how harmless the bees are
at swarming time, the bee-man in the first picture has taken
a handful of them, as we may see.</p>



<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_88">[88]</span>There is an old rhyme which says:</p>

<div class="poetry-container">
<div class="poetry">
<div class="first">&#8220;A swarm in May, worth a load of hay,</div>
<div class="verse">A swarm in June, worth a silver spoon,&#8221;</div>
</div></div>

<p>and the bee-keeper is pleased should his bees swarm in
May, for then he will be able to put them in a new hive,
and they will gather a good supply of honey before the
summer is over. Should the swarm take place a month
or two later, however, the bees do not settle down in time
to gather sufficient honey for the winter, and they cause
the bee-keeper trouble, for he has to feed them with syrup.</p>

<p>After a swarm, the bees seem to forget all about their
old life and companions, for the hive containing the swarm
may be placed quite close to the old hive without either
set of bees taking the slightest notice of the other.</p>

<p>If a bee-keeper is not at hand to take the swarm, the
bees will probably make their home in some hollow tree.
They will commence to build combs, and young bees will
be reared and honey stored just as in a hive.</p>

THE OLD HIVE AFTER A SWARM</h2>
</div>

<p class="drop-cap2">AFTER the old queen has left with the swarm, the bees
have to decide what to do about a new queen, and the
eldest princess is, as we have already seen, clamouring to
be set free from her cell. Although she gnaws away at the
floor of her cell the bees keep her a prisoner, by piling
more wax on the outside of the cell. She is kept thus
until the old queen has got away with the swarm, otherwise
there would be a terrible fight between the rival queens.</p>

<p>However, the bees now decide to set the young princess
at liberty, and two courses are open to them. If the hive
has got what is called the &#8220;swarming fever,&#8221; the princess
will lead a second swarm, for she knows that in a few days
another princess will be born. This second swarm is
called &#8220;the cast,&#8221; and unlike the first, flies away at once,
no matter what the weather may be, for there is no time
to be lost. The cast does not settle near the hive as the
first swarm does, but flies quite away, and is generally lost
to the bee-keeper.</p>

<p>If, as is generally the case, the hive has not got swarming
fever, the bees adopt the princess as their queen. As soon
as this course is decided upon, the bees allow her to visit
the cells containing her rivals, and with savage anger<span class="pagenum" id="Page_90">[90]</span>
she inserts her sting in each cell and puts them to
death.</p>

<p>During the next few days she wanders about the hive
in a restless fashion, constantly going to the door. After
a while she leaves the hive and flies high up into the air.
She is not allowed to go alone, however, but is followed
by numbers of drones. In about an hour&#8217;s time she returns,
and the bees know that she is now mated and will remain
quietly in the hive. The hive then resumes its ordinary
life, and the young queen commences to enter upon her
new duties. The queen cells are no longer required, and
so they are cut down; the builders set to work to erect
nursery cells in their place, for every available inch of room
will be required by the young queen for laying eggs.</p>

THE MASSACRE OF THE DRONES</h2>
</div>

<p class="drop-cap">WE have already seen that the drones do no work in
the hive, nor do they gather nectar or pollen. They
live a life of ease, feeding upon the honey gathered by the
workers, and it has been said that each drone eats as much
food as can be provided by four workers. You may understand
from this that the drones would quickly eat up the
provisions which have been gathered for the winter. The
workers know this too, and when the summer begins to go
and the flowers to fade, the drones will meet their fate.
They are always under the power of the workers, for
besides eating honey, they are given chyle food, and were
the workers not to give them this, at the end of three days
the drones would die, even though there was plenty of
honey around them.</p>

<p>It is not by starvation that the drones die, however, for
they are massacred by the bees. Some time about August,
perhaps, when the bees find that the honey is not coming
in as fast as it used to, the step will be taken, for they have
now to think about the winter months which are close at
hand. If there are any drone cells in the hive with eggs
or grubs in them, the workers tear them open, the young
drones are dragged out, and their bodies thrown out of the<span class="pagenum" id="Page_92">[92]</span>
door of the hive. Although the other drones may see
these proceedings they take no heed of them, but continue
to live their lazy life, and to eat their fill of honey. But
in a few days the signal for the massacre is given, and the
workers commence to put them to death. Throughout the
hive may be seen the workers chasing the drones over the
combs which, but a few days before, supplied them with
honey. The drones have no sting, nor any means of
defence, so that they are absolutely at the mercy of their
pursuers. The bee-city is alive with the terrible cries of
the victims, and as the workers catch the drones they commence
to bite off their wings. Sometimes, too, they will
even gnaw off the legs or the antenn&aelig; or cut through the
drone&#8217;s slender waist, their one idea being to disable him.
Some of the drones perhaps are able to escape from the
hive, and may seek refuge in flight, but after a few hours
they are back again. They cannot live without food, and
as they have never done any work, they do not know how
to gather it. When they return, the guard at the gate,
which is always doubled at this time, savagely fall upon
and kill them. Some do not return to the hive, but these
speedily perish of cold when the night air comes on. The
bees never sting the drones in the struggle, for the sting,
being barbed, would soon be pulled out by the roots were
it once inserted in the drone&#8217;s body. The bodies of those
that have been killed are carried out of the hive by the
undertakers, and a busy time they have, as you may
imagine.</p>

HONEY</h2>
</div>

<p class="drop-cap">IN the old days the people did not know where honey
came from. Pliny, the great Roman writer, says that
it came from the air, and that the stars helped to make it.
He tells us, too, that it was much better at the time of the
rising of the bright star Sirius, and goes on to say what a
pity it is that it is mixed with &#8220;the juices of the flowers,&#8221;
for, little suspecting that they are really the nectar itself,
he actually thought they spoilt its essence! Others
supposed that honey gathered whilst Jupiter and Venus
were in the sky with Sirius was able to effect miracles,
such as curing diseases and actually restoring the dead to
life! How curious and interesting are these old beliefs,
and yet how silly they seem to us. We know that honey
is really &#8220;juices of the flowers,&#8221; which have undergone a
wonderful change in the bees&#8217; stomachs; and that, although
it is very pleasant to the taste, it is not able to restore
the dead to life, or to work any other miracles of a like
nature!</p>

<p>There are many different qualities of honey, each depending
on the flowers from which the nectar is gathered.
There is, for instance, the beautiful almond-flavoured
honey from the apple blossom or the dark and strong<span class="pagenum" id="Page_94">[94]</span>
heather honey. But the honey which is perhaps the most
common and beautiful is that from clover. The white
clover blooms for about three weeks and then indeed are
the bees busy. Red clover is of little use, the florets being
too long for the bees to reach the nectar. It is true that
this might be obtained by the bee biting through the base
of each one, but when red clover is in bloom the white
is also to be had, and so of the two the bees naturally
prefer the white, where their tongues can easily gather up
the tiny drops of fluid. Later on, perhaps, when the white
clover is done, there will be a second crop of red, and the
bees are then glad to visit it, for the florets of the second
crop are shorter than those of the first. Clover honey is
light amber colour, and as clear as crystal. A bee-keeper
can tell by the taste of any honey from what flowers it
has come, and perhaps, too, from which part of the
country.</p>

<p>After the bees have filled up their combs with honey,
the bee-keeper puts some smaller frames in the second
chamber of the hive. These are called sections, and as a
rule they measure 4<sup><small>1</small></sup>&frasl;<sub><small>4</small></sub> in. &times; 4<sup><small>1</small></sup>&frasl;<sub><small>4</small></sub> in. If honey is still plentiful
the bees will then build combs in these sections, and fill
them with it, and so when this has been done the bee-keeper
may take away the sections, and it is in this manner
that honey is taken from the bees.</p>

<p>Each section contains about 1 lb. of honey, and you may
often see them for sale, at about one shilling each. Some
people prefer honey when it has been extracted from the
sections and put into glass jars; myself, I think it is far
nicer to eat it from the comb. An average hive will give
about 30 or 40 lbs. of honey a season, but you can easily<span class="pagenum" id="Page_95">[95]</span>
imagine that a great deal depends upon the weather. The
situation of the hive counts, too, for hives in the south of
England give more honey than do those farther north.
This is because the flowers in that part are much finer
and yield more nectar, and also because the climate is
warmer.</p>

MODERN BEE-KEEPING</h2>
</div>

<p class="drop-cap">WE have already seen that straw hives were formerly
used to keep bees in. They had many disadvantages,
and perhaps the greatest was that sections could not be
put on to collect the extra honey. The only way in which
it could be obtained was to kill the bees and to take the
honey they had stored for themselves. The bees were
generally suffocated by the fumes of burning sulphur, and
so you will see that besides being inconvenient this method
of bee-keeping was also very cruel. The hives with the
greatest number of bees were the healthiest, and they were
selected for treatment in this manner, for they had more
honey stored away than the weaker ones. In this way all
the best bees were killed off, and those that we have at the
present time are descended from poor ancestors. It will
be many years before they have been brought back to their
former state of excellence.</p>

<p>After the bees had been suffocated, the old bee-keepers
took out the combs. These were not built in frames as
are those of the present day, but were just made inside the
skep in any way the bees liked. The honey was then
extracted from them, but it was of very poor quality, for
pieces of broken comb, pollen, and even dead grubs, or<span class="pagenum" id="Page_97">[97]</span>
parts of the bees themselves, were mixed up with it. How
different this is from the beautifully clear honey obtained
by the modern methods.</p>

<p class="top"><span class="smcap">Plate XXXII</span></p>
<div class="figcenter"><img src="images/i_plate32.jpg" alt="" /></div>
<p class="caption">From a photograph by]<span class="gap">      [E. Hawks</span><br />

<br />
Sealing over the Honey Cells</p>

<p>After the cells have been filled with honey the bees
leave them uncovered for a little time, so that the water
in the honey may evaporate. The honey then ripens,
and the chemist bees place a tiny drop of formic acid in
each cell. When all is ready, the cells are sealed over,
and in Plate XXXII. we may see the bees at work doing
this. You will be interested to know that the English
bees do not quite fill the cells, and so the colour of the
honey does not show. Foreign bees, however, fill the
cells quite to the brim, which gives the comb a dark and
dirty appearance.</p>

<p>Nowadays the straw skeps are very seldom seen, for
their place is taken by the wooden hives we have already
considered. The frames containing the combs are all of
the same size, so that they may be transferred from one
hive to another. For instance, should a certain hive
have collected a large quantity of honey for winter use,
and another hive not have sufficient, the bee-keeper may
take one or two frames of this honeycomb from the rich
hive and put it into the poor one, and in this way both
lots of bees will live throughout the winter. In many
other ways the frame hives are useful, besides being
much more healthy. The bees need not be killed in
order to get the honey, as was necessary with the skeps,
for a puff or two of smoke is all that is required, and
while they are frightened we may remove the sections.</p>

<p>You will understand that the sooner the queen sees
pollen coming into the hive in the early spring, the sooner<span class="pagenum" id="Page_98">[98]</span>
will she commence laying eggs. The sooner the eggs are
laid, the more bees will there be ready for the summer
flowers. So the bee-keeper sprinkles pea-flour in a box
of shavings near the hive in the early days of spring.
The bees soon find the flour, and, thinking it is pollen,
they commence to carry it into the hive. When the
queen sees it coming in she is deceived, and thinks
summer is at hand; so she commences to lay eggs.
This gives the hive a start, so that when spring really
comes, there are large numbers of bees ready to gather
honey from the early flowers.</p>

<p>We have already mentioned that a great quantity of
honey has to be consumed before wax can be made, and
this is a serious loss to the bee-keeper, for it not only
reduces the stores, but also wastes valuable time as well.
So the bees are now provided with a thin sheet of wax,
a piece of which hangs downward in each frame. On it
is stamped the exact design of the cells, so that not only
is material provided for the bees, but the architects are
saved the trouble of having to map out where each cell
shall be. A piece of this &#8220;foundation,&#8221; as it is called, is
shown in Plate XXXIII. The bees readily take to it, and
as soon as the work of building is to commence they
knead the wax and draw it out from the foundation,
until it is a complete cell. In this way a great deal of
time is saved.</p>

THE BEES&#8217; ENEMIES</h2>
</div>

<p class="drop-cap">BEES have many enemies, apart from robber bees, who
try to steal their honey. In winter-time, when pressed
by hunger, certain birds come to a bee-hive and commence
tapping on the alighting-board. Of course some of the
bees come to the door to see what is the matter, and
no sooner do they appear on the threshold than the
sharp little birds grab them in their beaks, and so make
a meal. Birds often catch the bees as they are gathering
nectar in the fields, and no one knows how many perish in
this way.</p>

<p>Then there is the death&#8217;s-head moth, as it is called.
You no doubt know that this is an insect which bears on
its back markings like a skull, and hence its name. It
sometimes enters a hive and makes a chirping noise.
It is supposed that this fascinates the bees, and the
moth is therefore able to take whatever it wants in the
way of food.</p>

<p>Bees have fleas too, and though they are not very
formidable enemies, they are a nuisance. A picture of
one of these tiny mites is found in Plate XXXIV.</p>

<p>The worst enemies of the bees are diseases, of which
there are several kinds. The most dreaded are dysentery<span class="pagenum" id="Page_100">[100]</span>
and what is called the &#8220;Isle of Wight&#8221; disease. Many
of our soldiers died of dysentery in the South African
War, caused through their drinking bad water, and it is
the same kind of illness which attacks the bees. The
Isle of Wight disease is as peculiar as it is mysterious.
It resembles the dreaded sleeping sickness from which
natives of Africa suffer, and of which we have heard so
much these last few years. The bees seem to lose all
power of flying, and in a few days whole hives may die.
It is called the Isle of Wight disease because it first
appeared in that island a few years ago.</p>

POWERS OF COMMUNICATION</h2>
</div>

<p class="drop-cap">BEES have not, so far as we can tell, any system of
language such as we have, but it is quite certain
that they are able to communicate with one another.
Not only can they communicate simple facts, but they
actually can, in their way, talk or tell each other things.
How this is accomplished without any voice we are not
able to say, but it is certain that in this connection the
wondrous antenn&aelig; play a most important part. If you
watch bees on the board in front of the hive, you will
see them sometimes march up to one another and gently
cross the antenn&aelig;, as two duellists cross their swords
before a fight. For a fraction of a second one seems
to lightly tap the antenn&aelig; of the other, and it is evident
that some communication is passing between them. It
may be some important piece of news, or perhaps it
is just some hive gossip, of interest to both the little
insects. Who can tell?</p>

<p>An experiment which I have often tried with bees,
to show that there is the power of communication, is
to put a few drops of honey on a saucer, which must
then be placed at some distance from the hive, or there
would soon be a crowd of bees round it. Next, a bee<span class="pagenum" id="Page_102">[102]</span>
is entrapped and placed on the honey. She will commence
to sip it up, and as soon as she has taken as much
as she can carry will fly to the hive. When next she
comes back for honey she will probably be accompanied
by a friend; on the third or fourth visit, if the honey still
lasts, several more bees will also visit it, and all will be
busy carrying it to the hive. I should tell you, however,
that it does not always happen that the first bee will
bring friends. I have tried the experiment many times,
and have come to the conclusion that there is no doubt
the first bee does often tell other bees of her find, and
that they come to help her to gather in the treasure. In
this regard a still further experiment may be of interest.
Many of you no doubt have seen that beautiful fairy
play called <i>The Blue Bird</i>. This was written by an
author called Maurice Maeterlinck, who has also
written a very interesting book, <i>The Life of the Bee</i>.
Mr. Maeterlinck has suggested for this experiment that
honey should be placed on a plate or saucer some distance
from the hive, as in the other case. Then a bee
should be put to the honey and allowed to take in a
supply. While she is feeding she will be so deeply
interested that we are easily able to mark her by painting
a tiny spot of colour upon her back. Now away
flies the bee to the hive, and hands over the honey to
the house bees. She will then leave the hive and fly
back to the plate for more honey. She must be trapped
as she leaves the hive, and kept in a little box. Now
if bees have the power of communicating, we might expect
that the marked bee would have told some of the other
workers of her find. So far so good, but what we wish<span class="pagenum" id="Page_103">[103]</span>
to know from this experiment is whether or not the
marked bee was able to tell the other bees where to find
the honey, or whether she only said to them, &#8220;I know
where there is some honey. Follow me, and I will show
you.&#8221; Now if the latter was the case, when we trapped
the marked bee, the others would not be able to find
the honey, because they could not follow her. But, on
the other hand, if the marked bee had told her friends
how to find the honey, and had described to them exactly
where it was, it would not matter to these other bees
whether she was with them or not. Mr. Maeterlinck&#8217;s
result of this ingenious experiment left the question almost
as undecided as before. He tried it twenty times, but
only one strange bee found the honey, which was placed
in his study in the house. He asks, &#8220;Was this mere
chance, or had she followed instructions received?&#8221; I
have tried the same experiment a large number of times,
for it interests me very much. I am bound to say that
there appears to be some ground for believing that the
marked bees do actually give instructions to the others,
for in my case the honey was placed in a spot which was
quite out of the way of the voyages of the bees, and yet
on several occasions friends of the marked bees found
it; and though the honey might be left in exactly the
same position for a week or more before the experiment
was tried, yet not a single bee ever came to it.</p>

BEE FLOWERS</h2>
</div>

<p class="drop-cap">UNTIL quite recent times it was not thought that the
bees&#8217; visits to flowers were for any other purpose
than to gather food for themselves. It is now known,
however, that their visits are really necessary to the
flowers, and it is thought that flowers secrete nectar to
attract them. Some kinds of flowers contain more nectar
than others, and it is not always the largest which have the
most. Small flowers are quite as interesting to study, if
not more so, than large ones, and there is a great deal yet
to be learned about even the tiniest flower. A primrose
or a snowdrop possesses wonders which even the greatest
scientists of the day cannot completely fathom. Lord
Tennyson knew this when he wrote these beautiful lines:&mdash;</p>

<div class="poetry-container">

<p class="top"><span class="smcap">Plate XXXV</span></p>
<div class="figcenter"><img src="images/i_plate35.jpg" alt="" /></div>
<p class="caption">Delphinium</p>

<p>Nature has so arranged things that all plants do not
flower at the same time. Not only does this give us<span class="pagenum" id="Page_105">[105]</span>
flowers nearly all the year round, but it allows the bees
to work many months to gather in the stores for winter.
Have you noticed that as soon as one kind of flower is
over its place is taken by something else? Even though
this arrangement does exist, it would be of but little value
to the bees, unless the flowers were &#8220;honey&#8221; flowers&mdash;that
is to say, the sort which secrete good supplies of nectar.
Yet the bee-keeper knows that besides the ordinary
flowers, those kinds which are useful to bees also follow
one another from early spring to late autumn. There is
thus a sort of calendar of honey flowers all the year round.</p>

<p>The bees will wake from their winter sleep as soon as
the fine days of spring come, and it is then that the
crocus is in flower. This flower is rich in pollen, which
the bees commence to carry into the hive. In March
there will be the daffodil and several other wild flowers,
among which we may mention the dandelion and colts-foot.
In April the blackthorn and palm will appear,
whilst in May there will be a large number of wild flowers
ready, including the broom, hawthorn, and foxglove. But
June is the great bee month, for the fruit trees in the
orchards are covered with blossom, and the clover makes
the fields look white. Down in the south of England,
too, there is the sainfoin, a flower which gives a large
amount of nectar. In July the heather attracts those bees
who are near the moors, while bramble flowers cover the
hedges. In August there is still the heather, but the
flowers begin to go, and the bees feel that winter is drawing
near, and it is now that they make preparations for
their long sleep. The last flower of the year is generally
the ivy, which may be seen about October. This flower<span class="pagenum" id="Page_106">[106]</span>
gives a little nectar, but, as the days are now cold and wet,
the bees seldom leave the hives to gather it.</p>

<p>These are but a few of the best-known flowers, for there
are hundreds of other kinds, and it would be interesting
for you to make a calendar of your own. The two flowers
from which the most nectar is obtained, are the white
clover and the heather. Some flowers are of no use to
the bee, although they store large quantities of nectar, for
it is so placed that the bee cannot get to it, such as the
red clover.</p>

<p>We have seen that bees can distinguish between colours,
and it is even supposed that they have favourite colours,
and that they prefer blue to any other. If you are able
to watch a flower called delphinium, or larkspur (Plate
XXXV.), which is light blue, and grows in parks and
gardens, you will be surprised to notice what a number
of bees it attracts, even though there may be many other
kinds of flowers around.</p>

POLLEN</h2>
</div>

<p class="drop-cap">WHILST it is true that plants cannot speak or walk
about, yet they live a separate life of their own.
They breathe and sleep, feed and digest just as animals do,
but in a different manner. In order that we may understand
more about this and the use that bees are to them,
we must first learn a little about the construction of the
flowers themselves. Let us choose a daffodil about which
to speak, for it is both interesting and easily obtainable.</p>

<p>You will know that it is made up of &#8220;flower leaves,&#8221; and
that there is no calyx like that of a primrose, for instance.
The corolla is a deep yellow tube, and to it the flower
leaves are joined. If now we cut the flower in half, we find
that there is a long rod, called the style, at the end of
which is a kind of sticky knob, called the stigma; this you
will see on Plate XXXVI. There are six smaller rods grouped
round the style, and these are called the stamens. They
are thickened at the end near the stigma, and the thickenings
are called the anthers. The anthers are the pollen-bearing
parts of the flower, and though their position often
varies, you will find both anthers and stigma in nearly
every kind of flower. Below the corolla of the daffodil is
the ovary, and this is where the seeds are formed. If we<span class="pagenum" id="Page_108">[108]</span>
look in the ovary of our daffodil, we shall see several tiny
round objects of a transparent nature. These are called
the ovules, and in time they may become seeds. There is
a remarkable difference between an ovule and a seed, for
if we planted one of the former, it would simply wither and
decay in the ground. If, however, we set a seed, sooner
or later a plant, like that from which the seed was taken,
will spring up.</p>

<p>An ovule only becomes a seed after it has been fertilised,
and this is accomplished by some pollen being placed on
the stigma. The style is a kind of tube, and is connected
with the ovary, and when grains of pollen fall on the stigma
they send out long shoots, called pollen tubes. These
pollen tubes grow down the style till they reach the ovary.
Each pollen tube then finds an ovule, forces its way in,
and pours in nutrition from the pollen grain on the stigma
above. The ovules then undergo certain important
changes, and are turned into seeds. Pollen grains are of
all sizes and shapes, but they are generally very tiny indeed.
When I tell you that hundreds of grains of the kind would
take up no more room than a pin-head, you will understand
how very minute and wonderful are these tiny pollen
tubes.</p>

<p>The change in the ovules, which we have just read about,
is called fertilisation, and we know that this is necessary to
a plant if its ovules are to be changed into seeds. We
might imagine that there is no difficulty about this in the
cases of flowers where there are both anthers and stigma,
but it is a law of Nature that it is not desirable for flowers
to be fertilised by their own pollen. Why this should be
we do not know, but it certainly is an actual fact. By this<span class="pagenum" id="Page_109">[109]</span>
I do not mean to say that flowers cannot be fertilised by
their own pollen, but that they produce healthier and
more numerous seeds when fertilised by pollen from
another plant. Pollen from another flower of the same
plant will not do, but it should be from another plant
altogether. Of course the two plants must be of the same
kind, for it would not do to expect the pollen of a sweet-pea
to fertilise a wallflower.</p>

<p>Some flowers will not be fertilised at all by pollen from
their own plant, and one of these is clover. Mr. Darwin,
a scientist who has taught us a great deal about this
subject, tried an experiment in which he fertilised twenty
heads of clover by the pollen of other clover plants. They
produced no less than 2290 seeds, but when another twenty
heads of clover were kept from being fertilised by any but
their own pollen, not a single seed was produced.</p>

<p>No doubt you will be wondering why a flower is not
fertilised when anthers covered with pollen surround the
stigma. The explanation is very simple, for the stigma
has to become ripe before it can receive any pollen. In
some plants the stigma is ripe before the anthers give off
pollen, whilst in others all the pollen is given from off the
anthers before the stigma becomes ripe. Thus we see how
Nature prevents a flower from fertilising itself.</p>

BEES AND FLOWERS</h2>
</div>

<p class="drop-cap">FROM what you have read in the previous chapter you
will see that for a flower to be fertilised the pollen
must come from another plant. How, then, is this effected,
for plants cannot walk to one another and ask for each
other&#8217;s pollen? There are two ways in which Nature&#8217;s law
can be fulfilled. The first is by the wind, for the pollen
of some flowers, such as the willow-catkin, may be blown
on to the stigmas of other catkins, and thus fertilise them.
The stigmas of such plants are made branched and hairy,
so as to allow of their more easily catching the flying pollen
as it passes.</p>

<p>You will easily understand that it would not do for all
plants to be wind-fertilised, for the chances of pollen grains
alighting on stigmas would be very remote if that were the
case. By far the greater number of plants, therefore, are
fertilised in the second manner, which is by insects. The
bees are the most useful of all, and we now see what service
they render to plants, for when a little worker dips into a
flower in search of nectar, her body becomes covered with
pollen. It may be that the next flower she comes to is
one in which the stigma is ripe, so that the bee, as she
pushes her way in, rubs her pollen-covered body against it,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_111">[111]</span>
and thus the flower is fertilised by pollen from another
plant. When a bee is nectar-gathering, you will notice that
she always keeps to one kind of plant on each journey, just
as the pollen gatherers do. This arrangement fits in with
Nature&#8217;s plan, for it is thus that pollen of the sweet-pea is
carried to another sweet-pea, and not to a wallflower, and
so with each kind of plant.</p>

<p>Many people think that the beautiful colours and scents
of flowers exist only to delight man, but this is quite a
wrong idea. For instance, just think of the gorgeous
flowers which must grow and die in places where no human
eye ever sees them. The real state of affairs is that man
uses the flowers which already exist, and even if all men
were to die, flowers would still continue to blossom.</p>

<p>The more we study flowers, the more clearly does it become
evident that their rich colours, beautiful perfumes,
and sweet nectar are really baits to entice insects to visit
them. More than this, even the very marks in certain
flowers point to where the insect will find the nectar, just
as signposts on country roads direct us to the place we
wish to find. Have you noticed that flowers which have
gaudy colours, like the tulip, foxglove, or hollyhock, often
have no smell, whilst insignificant flowers, as the mignonette,
privet, or forget-me-not, give off beautiful scents? The
first kind attract insects by their colour, but the second by
their fragrance. Certain flowers have their nectaries at
the base of the corolla, as the geranium; others have tiny
little glands, or bags, on their petals, like the buttercup.</p>

<p>You will know that flowers open and close at different
hours&mdash;in fact it is almost possible to tell the time by
watching them. The little daisy is so called, for it is the<span class="pagenum" id="Page_112">[112]</span>
&#8220;day&#8217;s eye,&#8221; and it closes at sunset; but the evening primrose
is only just waking when the daisy is going to sleep. Who
does not know that honeysuckle gives off its sweet fragrance
in the evening-time? The reason for these facts is this.
The daisy is open during the daytime, because it is visited
and fertilised by insects who come only during the hours
of daylight. The evening primrose is fertilised by moths
which fly in the twilight and evening, and so it has no need
to be awake by day. We can easily see, too, that the tube-like
flower of the honeysuckle is far too long for the tongue
of the little bee to reach its nectar, and the corolla is so
narrow that she cannot creep down it. So the honeysuckle
relies for fertilisation on moths, who have far longer tongues
than bees, and it emits the lovely smell at evening-time to
attract them.</p>

HOW FLOWERS PROTECT THEIR
NECTAR</h2>
</div>

<p class="drop-cap">A WHOLE volume could be written on the marvellous
contrivances of flowers, but we must be content to
describe a few. It is a wonderful subject, and one which
you yourselves will be able to study quite easily.</p>

<p>Have you ever wondered why cup-shaped flowers&mdash;the
harebell, the snowdrop, and many others&mdash;droop their
heads? It is because they would become filled with rain
or dew if they did not do so, and thus their nectar would
be spoiled, and insects would no longer visit them. For
the same reason daisies will close their petals when dark
clouds come up, and will remain closed until the sun
shines again. Have you ever seen a flower of the white
dead nettle? It actually protects its nectaries with one
of its petals, which overhangs the others, and acts like a
little umbrella.</p>

<p>The ordinary nasturtiums (Plate XXXVII.) have the edge
of the three lower petals cut into fine strips. These keep
the rain from the nectar, which is situated at the end of
the long spur. You will notice that hive bees are not
often seen on nasturtiums, for their tongues are not long<span class="pagenum" id="Page_114">[114]</span>
enough to reach the nectar; so these flowers depend more
on humble-bees for fertilisation. The nasturtium is a
flower which illustrates very well what was said about
&#8220;honey-guides&#8221; just now, for all the lines on the petals
point to where the nectar is to be found.</p>

<p>Some flowers have to protect their honey from certain
insects, who wish to take it without fertilising the flower in
return. Ants, for instance, are very fond of honey; and,
as you can easily imagine, they are so small that they can
creep right down to the nectaries without dusting themselves
with pollen, or fertilising the flower. So certain
flowers&mdash;like the primrose&mdash;have their stalks covered with
multitudes of tiny hairs. These serve as a barricade to the
ant, and prevent it from climbing to the flower above. The
cross-leaved heather has its stalk and calyx covered with
sticky hairs, so that not only are the little thieves prevented
from getting to the flower, but they are actually
held prisoners as well.</p>

HOW FLOWERS ARE FERTILISED</h2>
</div>

<p class="drop-cap">WE have now seen something of the contrivances of
flowers to aid in their fertilisation, and in this
chapter we shall consider the ingenious arrangement some
flowers possess to assist their fertilisation.</p>

<div class="figcenter"><img src="images/i_125.jpg" alt="" /></div>
<p class="caption">(<i>a</i>)<span class="gap1">(<i>b</i>)</span></p>

<p>Let us first look at the primrose. Have you ever noticed
that there are two kinds of primrose flowers? From the
outside perhaps they look very similar, but if you look
closely, or better still, cut them open, you will find where
they differ. Let us look at these sketches and we shall
see that the one kind (<i>a</i>) has a long style, which reaches
nearly to the top of the corolla. The other kind (<i>b</i>)
has quite a short style, so that instead of the stigma, or
knob, being at the top of the corolla, it is really half-way<span class="pagenum" id="Page_116">[116]</span>
down. We notice, too, that the anthers, or pollen bags, in
the first kind (<i>a</i>) are placed half-way down the corolla, and
in the other flower (<i>b</i>) they are at the top. We might think
that Nature had made some mistake here, for it seems that
if the pollen bags belonging to flower (<i>a</i>) were placed in
flower (<i>b</i>), or <i>vice versa</i>, things would be more natural.</p>

<p>Let us suppose that a bee visits flower (<i>a</i>) and dips her
tongue down the corolla to collect the nectar. Half-way
down the flower the tongue has to pass the pollen bags,
and in doing so gets dusted over with pollen grains. The
bee, having collected the nectar, flies to another plant,
which we will suppose bears flowers of the other kind.
She dips down her tongue, which touches the stigma just at
the place where it had been covered with pollen by the
first flower. By this means, therefore, the flower (<i>b</i>) is
fertilised. But, you will ask, what about flower (<i>a</i>)? While
the fertilisation of flower (<i>b</i>) has been going on, the pollen
bags of (<i>b</i>) at the top of the corolla have dusted the root
of the bee&#8217;s tongue, so that when she goes to a flower of
the (<i>a</i>) type, the pollen dust at the root of her tongue
touches the stigma, and the flower is thus fertilised.</p>

<p>What a wonderful arrangement this is, for you will see
that it is almost impossible for the flowers of one primrose
plant to fertilise each other; the pollen must come from
the flowers of a different plant.</p>

<p>Some flowers, if not fertilised by insects, have the power to
fertilise themselves, and to this class belongs the sweet-pea
(Plate XXXVIII.). This flower belongs to the <i>papilionaceous</i>
(butterfly) tribe, and when a bee alights on the flower its weight
presses down the underpart. While the bee is taking the
nectar, the pollen bags rise and touch her on the underside of<span class="pagenum" id="Page_117">[117]</span>
the thorax. Then she goes on to another flower whose stigma
is ripe. This time the stigma rises and touches the same part
of the bee&#8217;s body, and in this manner the flower is fertilised.</p>

<p class="top"><span class="smcap">Plate XXXVIII</span></p>
<div class="figcenter"><img src="images/i_plate38.jpg" alt="" /></div>
<p class="caption">Sweet Pea</p>

<p>Some plants have wonderful arrangements for transferring
their pollen to other flowers, some of which are so
peculiar and clever that we might think they had been designed
by some crafty scientist. One of these is called the
salvia, and it belongs to the same family as the dead nettle.
The anthers are mounted like a see-saw, and when the bee
makes its way into the flower it pushes one end of the see-saw
up. This causes the other end, on which the pollen
bags are situated, to come down thump on to the bee&#8217;s back.
The pollen is thus scattered there, and the bee also receives
what may be called a pat on the back! As the salvia
flower grows old its pollen bags shrivel up, but at this
time the stigma is ripe. It grows longer and longer, and
bends over till it is like a letter J turned upside down: <img src="images/i_205.jpg" alt="" />
After a bee has visited some young flowers and had her
back dusted with pollen, she will, without doubt, visit some
of the older ones too, and it is quite easy to understand
that when she enters these she rubs her back against the
overhanging stigma, and the pollen adheres to it.</p>

<p>Another interesting plant is the violet, the nectar of
which is stored at the end of the long spur, which you will
have noticed. The pollen bags fit closely round the stigma,
and so when pollen drops from them it does not fall out of
the flower, for its passage is blocked by the tight-fitting
pollen bags. When the bee comes, she has to push her
tongue right up the spur, and in doing this she forces it
past the pollen bags. This causes the pollen to fall out on
to her head, and so it is carried to the next flower.</p>

CONCLUSION</h2>
</div>

<p class="drop-cap2">ALTHOUGH very much more could be written on this
interesting subject, yet there is a limit to all things,
and we come now to the end of this little book.</p>

<p>If you did not know or care much about bees when
you began Chapter I., I hope that what you have read will
help you to understand something about these wonderful
insects. The study of parts of their bodies, or Anatomy,
as it is called, teaches us a great deal, and helps us to
understand all the more clearly how they perform the
duties of the hive, and how they collect their food.</p>

<p>Although the wonders of the hive, the combs, their
building and design, the different workers and their duties,
are marvellous, yet the ways of the bees themselves are
far more wonderful, and we cannot fully understand them.
It is not known at the present time whether the bees
are able to think and reason, or whether they simply do
these things by instinct. This alone is a great subject,
and one on which there have been endless discussions
among the cleverest scientists in the world, and yet we get
no nearer the truth.</p>

<p>If you are not able to study the habits of the bees in
the hive, there is nothing to prevent you from watching<span class="pagenum" id="Page_119">[119]</span>
them when they are at work in the garden or hedgerow.
It is always very pleasant to hear the happy song of the
foragers on a summer afternoon as they flit from flower
to flower on their task.</p>

<p>The study of flowers, or Botany, is most interesting,
especially when considered in relation to insects. It was
not till comparatively recent years that it was found they
were connected; but one day a young German botanist,
called Sprengel, happened to notice some tiny hairs growing
in the centre of a wood-geranium. He determined to
find out what purpose these hairs served, and ultimately
proved that they protected the nectar of the little flower
from the rain. From this apparently trivial discovery it
was found that most plants were fertilised by insects. It
seems almost as though Nature had intended flowers and
insects to fit in with each other, and it is very wonderful to
think of this when we remember that they belong to two
different kingdoms. A great deal has yet to be learned
about bees and flowers, for there are all sorts of curious
devices in flowers which we do not yet understand. It is
important to remember that the bees do not know that
they are fertilising the flowers, for they only think of
collecting nectar, and carry the pollen from one plant to
another quite accidentally.</p>

<p>Always remember that a bee will not sting you unless
it is annoyed, or unless you hurt it. If it does sting you
for this reason, do not kill it, for it is only doing what
it has a right to do, although it may be a painful right!
I knew some boys who used to spend Saturday afternoons
seeing who could kill the most bees. One day they ran
to me and told me that they had actually killed 172 bees<span class="pagenum" id="Page_120">[120]</span>
between them. Of course I told them how cruel I
thought they were, but they had never thought of it in
this way, and after I had shown them one of my hives
and explained a few of the wonders of the bee-city, they
said how sorry they were, and you may be sure they have
never killed a bee since.</p>

Section 2. Information about the Mission of Project Gutenberg&#8482;
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
Project Gutenberg&#8482; is synonymous with the free distribution of
electronic works in formats readable by the widest variety of
computers including obsolete, old, middle-aged and new computers. It
exists because of the efforts of hundreds of volunteers and donations
from people in all walks of life.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
Volunteers and financial support to provide volunteers with the
assistance they need are critical to reaching Project Gutenberg&#8482;&#8217;s
goals and ensuring that the Project Gutenberg&#8482; collection will
remain freely available for generations to come. In 2001, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation was created to provide a secure
and permanent future for Project Gutenberg&#8482; and future
generations. To learn more about the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation and how your efforts and donations can help, see
Sections 3 and 4 and the Foundation information page at www.gutenberg.org.

Section 4. Information about Donations to the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
Project Gutenberg&#8482; depends upon and cannot survive without widespread
public support and donations to carry out its mission of
increasing the number of public domain and licensed works that can be
freely distributed in machine-readable form accessible by the widest
array of equipment including outdated equipment. Many small donations
($1 to $5,000) are particularly important to maintaining tax exempt
status with the IRS.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
The Foundation is committed to complying with the laws regulating
charities and charitable donations in all 50 states of the United
States. Compliance requirements are not uniform and it takes a
considerable effort, much paperwork and many fees to meet and keep up
with these requirements. We do not solicit donations in locations
where we have not received written confirmation of compliance. To SEND
DONATIONS or determine the status of compliance for any particular state
visit <a href="https://www.gutenberg.org/donate/">www.gutenberg.org/donate</a>.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
While we cannot and do not solicit contributions from states where we
have not met the solicitation requirements, we know of no prohibition
against accepting unsolicited donations from donors in such states who
approach us with offers to donate.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
International donations are gratefully accepted, but we cannot make
any statements concerning tax treatment of donations received from
outside the United States. U.S. laws alone swamp our small staff.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
Please check the Project Gutenberg web pages for current donation
methods and addresses. Donations are accepted in a number of other
ways including checks, online payments and credit card donations. To
donate, please visit: www.gutenberg.org/donate

Section 5. General Information About Project Gutenberg&#8482; electronic works
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
Professor Michael S. Hart was the originator of the Project
Gutenberg&#8482; concept of a library of electronic works that could be
freely shared with anyone. For forty years, he produced and
distributed Project Gutenberg&#8482; eBooks with only a loose network of
volunteer support.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
Project Gutenberg&#8482; eBooks are often created from several printed
editions, all of which are confirmed as not protected by copyright in
the U.S. unless a copyright notice is included. Thus, we do not
necessarily keep eBooks in compliance with any particular paper
edition.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
Most people start at our website which has the main PG search
facility: <a href="https://www.gutenberg.org">www.gutenberg.org</a>.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
This website includes information about Project Gutenberg&#8482;,
including how to make donations to the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation, how to help produce our new eBooks, and how to
subscribe to our email newsletter to hear about new eBooks.
